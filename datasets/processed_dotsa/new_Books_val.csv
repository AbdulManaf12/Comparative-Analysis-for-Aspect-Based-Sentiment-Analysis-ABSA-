"Ill start this review out by saying that I am an amateur author . I know my writing is n't New York Times Best Selling material , I can be honest with myself . I edit my own work , as editing services can be pricey . BUTRaymond E. Feist IS an award winning , New York Times Best Selling Author . He has a writing contract and has professional editors working with him . And my books are still better edited than this book . Period . Hands down , my favorite author in the genre , possibly favorite in all genres , Feist let me down with this book . There were gaping holes in the plot , multiple ( I mean lots ) incomplete sentences and a truly lackluster approach that left me feeling cheated . There is a part of the story early on where Pug ( THE main character , in my opinion ) and two others are investigating an island and stumble onto something amazing . The chapter ends . About 100 pages later , the storyline switches to Pugs son , Magnus , talking with the two companions of Pug from the earlier chapter and he says , You need to tell my father what weve found on this island . Really ? Magnus did n't find it , Pug did . That is a major error . You cant fix that . And he didnt . It just went from there , and got worse . I dare say I found an error of some sort on every other page . The storyline was n't anything I hadnt read from Feist before , either . A princess needs to escape before she is forced into a marriage she doesnt want , blah , blah , blah . Its almost the same exact storyline as the original four books of this lengthy series . Granted , I still read it , as I love the world he has created . But really ? Come up with something different . And the title , A Crown Imperiledwhich crown ? I can make an assumption , but it really was n't as main a part of the storyline as I would have expected . Okay , enough complaining . The book is critical to the series , but it felt like it was written by someone else other that the named author . I still enjoy the world developed , and I still love the characters Feist has created . I have already forgiven him and have moved on to the last book in the series . I just hope it doesnt leave me the way this one left me.2.5 of 5 Stars ( rounds to 3 , just because its Feist )","book--characters, book--approach, book--gaping holes in the plot, book, book--world, book--Feist, book--storyline, book--sentences, A Crown Imperiledwhich, It","Positive, Negative, Negative, Mixed, Positive, Positive, Negative, Negative, Negative, Negative"

"This is a fantastic book for anyone interested in cancer treatment . I was an oncology nurse years ago , but have not practiced in that area for years . It was a JOY to read of the cures for some of the diseases that we simply had nothing to use to treat patients when I was working . This book is surprisingly easy to read , and even enjoyable , as the author put it together in a way that is not just chronological , but that manages to pull the strings to connect thoughts and ideas . I encourage anyone interested in health care , science , cancer treatment or even the march of human knowledge to read this book .",book,Positive
"I have read and enjoyed many Swedish police thrillers of which The Stranger is one . All these have elements in common- primarily the twisted thread of painfully accumulated evidence from interviews and combing records eventually leading up to the capture of the murderer after a violent denoument . Along side the procedural details there are one or more subplots usually involving the policeman\ 's hard lot in maintaining a happy home life in the face of all the long hours he spends on the murder cases . All these elements are present in The Stranger . Parts of the story read like a soap opera as we follow the hero\ 's girl friend planning her wedding , choosing a dress , music for the reception etc . Something that sets The Stranger apart from many others is the large number of named characters-I counted 80 in a 370 page book- many of the 80 were children , or minor characters , but surely this must come close to the records set in Russian novels . The serious part of the plot concerns a rather far-fetched series of revenge murders seemingly unrelated but which the detectives manage to link together and zero in on a very surprising conclusion . Altogether a satisfying read .",read,Positive

"Feist is one of my favorite authors . I have followed Pug 's adventures and trials through most of the different min-series . The Chaos War set continues to be well written , but in A Crown Imperiled I think the author is trying flip from one sub plot to the next too quickly . Yes , the reader is aware of what the main characters are doing almost simultaneously , but it jumps around too much for my taste , particularly toward the end of the book . I would prefer longer segments for the exploits of the different character groupings . This one does leave you hanging on a cliff , but I 'll let you find out what that means on your own .","one--Feist, one--end, one--Chaos War, one, it","Positive, Negative, Positive, Mixed, Negative"
"Nevare gives himself over to the Speck magic , and this book is spent mostly under the influence of his other half Soldier\ 's Boy while the Nevare half of his soul is pushed around and silenced . This makes for a confusing , frustrating read as pages upon pages are written between the spiritual struggle of the two halves without anything really interesting happening . We are given insight into the Speck world and their Great Ones , hugely fat sorcerers that do nothing but eat and have feeders so that they eat the stuff that makes them the fattest ( and thus getting fat with magic ) . The fatter the sorcerer , the more powerful and Nevare/Soldier\ 's Boy is determined to be the fattest of all so he can somehow save both his human people and the Specks . The whole thing reads like a primitive food lover\ 's guide as they stuff themselves with every kind of mushroom and fantasy fruit imaginable . The Great Ones are like giant human slugs ( Jabba the Hut , yes ) . Of course near the end he manages to break free from his turmoil and perhaps save some of the people he cares about . Why can\'t the Specks see him near the end ( they can see other humans , magic or no magic ) ? Why did Lisana make that last grab for eternity with Nevare when she already had a piece of him already ? ( this was really at odds with her personality in the book )  . Confusing and just plain awful to read . Would not call this an epic by any stretch of the imagination .",book,Negative
"I came to this book with an open mind as i was in the States or abroad while all the Diana intrigue was going on and i do n't read magazines . I 'm from London . Facinating-so it says the Queen had a nanny who later behaved like an imperious queen because she had so many confidences from thee Queen and the royal house-hold tip-toed around her or it was 'off with their heads'and she drank champagne ONLY of it was served on a platter . Then , in another book on Diana , it says Charles 's butler used to have his music blaring from the floor below the Queen mother 's at Balmoral . My point is when servants get all the close confidences of their royal masters/mistresses it makes them feel personally royal too . A huge promotion considering they started off their careers as brown-nosers . So reading this book i could n't help feeling the same thing had happened to Mr Burrell and it would count as a drop in prestige to mention anything untoward about Diana . The ego shining through this book was my constant companion so i read it like an article in a woman 's magazine ...",book,Positive

However , I found this book to be more of a first person narrative on how Gordon built his collection of restaurants over the span of his early career .

"I have been reading Feist since he began writing ; I even got the chance to meet him in a small book store when he would make small appearances ( back before he became popular ) . He was an impressive man to meet . But with every new Feist book , the font size gets bigger and the margins wider . Compare a Feist book to a Martin or Erikson book there are 10 times the amount of words per page . I avoid buying Feist in hardcover because I feel as though I am already buying half a book , why spend the extra for half anyway . He seems to just be pushing the books out for the money and nothing else , shame . But that being said , I still like the characters , the story and his style .

"Unlike some other Scandinavian authors , Camilla Lackberg\ 's protagonist , Detective Patrik Hedstrom , is a relatively normal person , about to be married and living with Erica and their baby girl , surreptitiously running the small police station in a little western coastal town in Sweden , Fjallbacka nominally headed by a superior . Three things happen in the town to set off a wide-ranging investigation . First , Fjallbacka is invaded by a reality television show , with all the attendant problems and a cast motivated to drink , have sex and act in public to excess . And then , there is a local woman , known to abhor alcohol , who dies in a car crash with a blood level containing enormously high levels of alcohol . Then one night , after a drunken orgy , one of the contestants on the show is found murdered . Plenty to keep Patrik and his team occupied with few leads and plenty of questions . This is the fourth novel published by the author in the United States , and each has been consistently high quality , well-plotted , carefully translated and well written Perhaps most importantly , the characters are natural , every-day type of people , living typical lives and working hard . The plot lines move forward with logic , and the loose ends come together at the end smoothly . ( It should perhaps be noted that this book was originally published in the UK and Canada under the title The Gallows Bird . ) Highly recommended .","book--characters, book--quality, book--plot lines, book","Positive, Positive, Positive, Positive"

"When I read that Ken Burns had taken this book for a TV Series , it caught my attention . I had figured it for a dry , Pulitzer Prize winning book . At about the time I noticed that Ken Burns had done the work and it had already been broadcast , my husband started Chemotherapy . So , I bought the book to better understand this Emperor . What a GREAT read . It is VERY well written . Understandable by non-scientists , a far amount of drama . It is sectioned in manageble segments and it turned into a page turner . Quite astonishing . Setting aside cancer , it also had important observations regarding research and its funding , the examples of working separately and how sometimes amazing collaborations were almost accidental . The shift to privately funded research and how it shifts to profit centers and leaves behind areas of interest that might benefit mankind . Fascinating . I bought the book and then also bought the e-version . I can more easily share the book , which is WORTH sharing and reading .","book--observations, book","Positive, Positive"
"I\ 've been with Raymond Feist and the world of Midkemia almost the whole ride since 1982 , and with the publication of A Crown Imperiled ( Harper Voyager , $ 27 . 99 , 469 pages ) , he is one book removed from wrapping up the saga of Pug the magician and the battle against the undefined evil known as the Dread . A Crown Imperiled , which is book two of the Chaoswar Saga , is book 28 of the Riftwar Cycle , which actually began in the mid-1970s as a role-playing game at the University of California at San Diego . And even though one might expect Feist to be going through the motions at this point , the world has become so richly imagined that he is able to keep both his own and his readers\ ' enthusiasm going after 30 years . So if you have liked any of Feist\ 's previous books , you\ 'll enjoy A Crown Imperiled - and if you\ 're a fan of high fantasy ( that is , a pre-industrial world with magic and other races aside from human ) , then go back and start with Magician , as Feist has carefully crafted a long-running series that has evolved into one of the best of its kind . Of course , some books are better than others , and in this one , Feist can\'t resist bringing back some characters he already killed off -- but at least he doesn\'t go the lengths Brian Herbert and Kevin Anderson did in their sorry finish to the Dune series . Feist has never been great on the romance aspect of such novels , and A Crown Imperiled is no exception , but there are some surprises that keep the pages turning , and have me looking forward to the next , and supposedly final , volume .","series, A Crown Imperiled, A Crown Imperiled--surprises, Feist, A Crown Imperiled--world","Positive, Mixed, Mixed, Positive, Positive"

"A year or so ago , I was pretty much ready to give up on Nordic crime . Harry Hole was too drunken , Salander was too weird , and frankly the whole genre seemed too angst-ridden and downright miserable to be enjoyable ... and I say that as someone hardened by years of dealing with drunks and screwed-up mavericks - all fictional , of course ! At the time of my disillusionment , a fellow Amazon reviewer tried to get me to read Lckberg , promising that she was different . Finally , I 've followed that advice - and I 'm so glad I did ! Patrik Hedstrm is that rare and precious creature - a sober , likeable , intelligent detective who works within the rules and has a happy home life . And in this story he proves that that can be considerably more interesting and much more enjoyable than reading yet one more description of binge-drinking , hangovers and cowboy policing . When Patrik is called to the scene of a fatal car accident , it looks like a straightforward case of drunken driving . But the woman driver was teetotal and Patrik suspects that there may be more to the accident than meets the eye . Meantime the town has been invaded by a reality TV show starring a group of C-List celebs whose claim to fame is that they are willing to get outrageously drunk , party all night and have sex as often as they can , and all with the cameras rolling . This is problem enough , but when one of the celebs turns up dead in a bin , Patrik has two cases to deal with . So it 's lucky there 's a new member of the team - Hanna , an experienced and efficient officer has transferred to the district - especially since more deaths are on the way ... Well written , and well translated by Steven T Murray , this is an intriguing police procedural with a dark and complex plot and a satisfying conclusion . Although Patrik is the lead character , we get to know the members of his team too and their interactions add an extra layer of depth to the story . The picture Lckberg paints of contemporary Sweden is as misery-laden and angst-filled as the most ardent Nordic fan could desire , but is lightened by Patrik 's family life as he and Erica prepare for their forthcoming wedding . Although there 's clearly a running story in the background about Patrik and Erica 's relationship , this book works well as a standalone for anyone who , like me , has n't read the previous ones in the series - an omission I now intend to rectify . Recommended .

"I was glad to find an unabridged recording of a Stuart B MacBride book . Too many are abridged , and only available abridged in audiobook format . But after starting it , I can not continue listening to this audiobook . I will read it instead . The author should stick to writing his books , and not reading them aloud . Or if he does read them aloud , he ought to take the approach of doing it in one voice , without attempting accents and character voices . Because he 's not an actor . And thus , some of his female characters have very deep , very gruff voices . And some of his male characters have smooth & high pitched voices . And many characters sound alike , or end up sounding alike in some scenes because MacBride simply does n't seem to have the skills to pull it off , using multiple character voices , each distinctly different from one another , and each consistent throughout the book , and throughout scenes . MacBride IS a skilled novelist . But he 's not a skilled actor , voice actor or otherwise . But nowadays there are many who are ( even though we lost Frank Muller years ago ) . So I really , really hope MacBride and his publisher choose to employ professional voice actors in all future book by the author .

"I read Burrell\ 's other book , A Royal Duty and came away feeling that the author was obsessed with his employer and that he was a neurotic . Addtionally , I was inclined to think his character was somewhat questionable due to the surrounding Scotland Yard case against him ( although he was acquitted ) as well comments made by others during interviews I\ 've seen and other things I\ 've read . However , I really thought this book , The Way We Were was a nice tribute to Diana , Princes of Wales , and I think Burrell did a nice job in tyring to dispel the myths , gossip , and rumors that have surrounded this much written about subject . I particulary enjoyed reading his recollections about Diana\ 's relationship with Hasnat Khan and his two sons\ ' recollections of their childhood friendship with Princes William and Harry . These new bits of information were delivered in a heart-felt manner , and most importantly , I believe the contents of the book to be absolutely true .

"I am no closer to being an oncologist now than I was before I read the book , but it does have some laymens terms in it . It also has some testimonial stories in it , although more often than not they are the lab stories of the doctors involved instead of the patients . Still the book has popular appeal because it is a history and the subject concerns what any healthy adult has in the back of his mind . This book makes many references to Susan Sontag , a name I only otherwise know from a Dana Carvey imitation of Woody Allen , who also happens to be quoted in the book for saying , I do n't want to be immortal because of the movies I make . I want to be immortal by not dying . Other diseases referenced include tuberculosis , because of its domineering effect on society as a whole , as well as AIDS originally Gay-Related Immune Deficiency , which by viral connections was commonly thought to be another form of cancer . Early studies concerned blood , and the archaic suppuration of blood before leukemia was coined as the disease of the white blood cells . Sidney Farber and Carla are introduced , as pioneering doctor and Mukherjees patient respectively , at the same time . Against all odds , Carla does survive and is the thinly referenced but longest storyline in the book . A history of chemotherapy , radiation , X-rays , and pharmacy keeps the book moving over the past 150 years . Proper ways to measure treatment are debated , such as remission durations for those under fifty , or sixty or seventy , versus those over a given age . I am now basically clear on what is meant by acute symptoms or diseases . Mukherjees most basic explanation for increased cancer rates are smoking and the elimination of small pox , typhoid , TB , and inferior health care . The opportunity to live longer lives has made cancer an inevitability of the self . Unlike Marie Curie , whose exposure to scientific study killed her , typical cases of breast , cervical , and prostate cancer are for the most part unsolicited , cigarettes and their poor regulation being the exception . Mukherjee is noncommittal enough about cell phone use for me to think 2005 studies about brain tumors should not be dismissed . The Philadelphia Chromosome was some of the more complex scientific material related from the more modern genetic research . The Jimmy Fund was about a Swedish kid , who survived , named Einer who was a fan of the Boston Braves but connected to Ted Williams . The best writing may be the last two pages , a story that tempers nave optimism a reader might want to insist on , the death of Germaine Berne after six years of winning and losing against intestinal cancer . The authors stance overall on drugs would seem to be supportive , despite this quote from Voltaire : Doctors are men who prescribe medicines of which they know little , to cure diseases of which they know less , in human beings of whom they know nothing .

"This is # 4 for the Camilla Lackberg series ( also called The Stranger ) and is the lesser of her mysteries . While I enjoyed the first 3 very much , sometimes for the flashback sub-plots more than the mysteries , this one had a sub-par plot and mystery . More interesting for me in this one , and I have read the whole series , was the relationship between Patrik and Erica and family . Lackberg continues the Peyton Place like atmosphere of the small Swedish town and all of her books have something to do with parenthood , on some level , and this is no exception . She does an excellent job of setting the reader up for the next in the series , which is also good but somewhat predictable . A strong series but , for me , most of the interest comes as much from the plot lines of the characters ( her sister , the police captain , Erica & Patrik , etc . ) as it does from the mysteries . My suggestion would be to read the series in order ( The Ice Princess , the Preacher , The Stonecutter ) to enjoy them the most .","series, Lackberg, Stranger, series--plot lines, Stranger--job, Stranger--relationship between Patrik and Erica and family, first 3","Positive, Negative, Mixed, Positive, Mixed, Positive, Positive"

"I have read everything Diana for years and find Paul 's books to likely be closest to the truth . If you look at them objectively , they really are n't very flattering . I sometimes wonder if he realizes how intensely painful it is to read of his service to someone who was obviously cracked in the head . Not just a little , either . I am solidly convinced Diana was a well-intentioned , howling loon , which is very obviously what Paul does n't want anyone to think . The trouble is that he is distressingly honest about his impressions , so much so , that you can feel him fight with his own conscience about what and what not to share . He strikes me as an empathetic person who truly helping her hold it together on pain of his employment . I understood Diana to have issues with some of her staff , and yes , Paul does go into a bit of that with the same truthful tone that dominates all his writings . It really does nothing to evoke sympathy for her character , although Paul 's innate empathy - a talent that must have been particularly attractive to the Windsors - strives to do so . He really did feel a specific devotion towards Diana , and after reading his books , I think it may have to do with his believing he made a genuine difference in her life . Perhaps he did ? It 's difficult to tell from Paul 's perspective , as he does attempt in places to adhere to an impartiality that lends credibility to his story . It all just seems so terrifically sad . From her relationship with the heart surgeon , Dr .  Hasnat , to the way she confided things to Paul that he had no business being burdened with , you get the idea that this charming , sophisticated Princess was daft as a box of frogs and boiling not to show it . You also achieve about half way through the book that Paul , despite his candor , is concealing that much more which would obviously cement a brutal impression of someone who was struggling with any number of bewildering issues . It 's not just Diana , though . The system that she lived in was daft from end to end , and Paul was part and parcel of it . She 's dead , and he 's gone away from the royal family now , which is likely to improve Paul 's own family 's situation . He 's selling wine and things , and has branded his name , which in my opinion , should have happened long ago , as he solidly deserves notoriety for pleasing a group of tragically difficult people stuck in an Edwardian reality .","book--Paul--service, book, book--service, Paul","Negative, Negative, Negative, Mixed"
"After reading six books in the series I have become a reluctant fan of author Stuart MacBride . His books just gallop along from one violent activity to another . The characters are so complex as to be almost unbelievable . DI Steele is a case in point - she is so 'way out ' there , so vulgar , so rough , but in a funny way she becomes almost 'cute ' and likeable ...  . but it does take six books to get to this point . There are plots within plots within plots ...  . puts the book into the 'almost can not put down ' category . However if left for 24 hours it can be difficult to pick up where it left off . Nevertheless ( and in small doses ) Mr MacBride 's books are thoroughly enjoyable ... .I am looking forward to reading book 7 after a short period of recovery reading one of James Oswald 's crime mysteries ( a colleague and apparently good friend of Mr MacBride ) .","book--DI Steele, book 7, book--Mr MacBride, book, book--way, Mr MacBride 's books","Mixed, Positive, Positive, Mixed, Positive, Positive"

"The conclusion to Robin Hobb\ 's Soldier Son trilogy , Renegade\ 's Magic , is much like the first two books in the series . This has to be one of the most slow-moving , in-depth character and fantasy-setting studies that I have ever read . I greatly enjoyed the first two books ( Shaman\ 's Crossing and Forest Mage ) , but as the pace remained glacial , my love for the series waned a bit . Once again , I love Hobb\ 's characterization skills but it was almost a chore to get through this book . Not a good way to end a series , but still not bad . Hobb has created a wonderfully detailed society in the Specks , and she spends a lot of time in Renegade\ 's Magic exploring it as Navarre and Soldier\ 's Boy try to come to terms with what\ 's become of them . This book , as is the rest of the series , is told in first person by Navarre , but for much of the book Navarre is a disembodied presence in Soldier\ 's Boy\ 's body . Thus , we get many passages of Navarre being horrified by what Soldier\ 's Boy is doing with his body , of Navarre trying to either take control of the body or of him trying to influence Soldier\ 's Boy\ 's thinking . Narratively , I\ 'm sure there\ 's a reason for it , but occasionally it becomes obvious that Hobb needed time to pass quickly so she has Soldier\ 's Boy cause Navarre to disappear for a while . Since we see through Navarre\ 's eyes , we don\'t see anything until he wakes up again . I did greatly appreciate the depth that Hobb brings to Navarre and to Soldier\ 's Boy as well , the latter of which is even more impressive given the fact that we only see him through Navarre\ 's eyes . Yes , one could say that this entire series is a 2000+ page character study of Navarre , in addition to a fantasy examination of the struggles between nature and science/technology , but the character study is the most interesting part . Hobb\ 's characterization skills come to the fore once again , and my interest in Navarre is what kept me going through some of the slower passages . Sadly , the climax of the book brings the societal conflict to a close in an almost paint-by-numbers format . When Nevarre finally realizes what he has to do , he quickly goes about doing it and in the process uncovers some of the nuggets Hobb buried in the previous book in order to make the ending even more convenient . The tension between the two societies was delicious , as well as the struggle by the Specks to find some way to combat the building of the road . It\ 's just too bad most of the book feels like Navarre and Soldier\ 's Boy pounding their heads against the wall until suddenly everything becomes clear . Renegade\ 's Magic , and consequently the rest of the Soldier\ 's Son series , isn\'t for everybody . Some will find the slow pace extremely annoying and will put the first book down long before getting into the story . If the thought of this kind of story repels you , I would think you would have to be a big Hobb fan in order to enjoy it . It even battered me down at times , with the books getting increasingly harder to get through . I still think they are worth the journey , though , and Renegade\ 's Magic is a fitting conclusion to everything that came before . It\ 's an interesting experiment , and while I\ 'm not sure I want to read something like this again too soon , I don\'t feel my time has been wasted .

"Will Adams creates a new thriller character destined to be a long-running series of best sellers . Daniel Knox is a knock-around archaeologist in Egypt with a history of interesting relationships with his brethren and sponsors . The supervisor of a construction project in Alexandria stumbles onto a potential site of the final resting place of Alexander the Great , whose body was coveted as a justification for power by his successors in Egypt , the Ptolemys , Alexander 's native Macedonians . The race begins in the fashion of an Indiana Jones movie . Knox is pursued by a bad guy for saving a young girl from being raped by the tyrant . Along the way , there is a budding love affair with a woman who blamed Knox for the odd death of her archaeologist father , an evil female colleague who seems easily seduced by lovers and sources of money , a little girl desperately in need of a bone marrow transplant , rich Macedonian nationalists intent on using Alexander 's body as the means , after more than 2,000 years , of fomenting revolution to establish a separate Macedonia out of Greece and Balkan states . The Alexander Cipher beautifully blends the history of Alexander and his successors into an entertaining , rip-roaring , action-packed , page-turning adventure . The past of Daniel also will not remain there , as the female protagonist in the story , Gillie , moves from a hatred attributable to the strange death of her father to something more beautiful .

Aberdeen and its residents are suffering through another miserable winter , and some old names crop up as Edinburgh 's Malk the Knife once more encroaches on the criminal world of Aberdeen . It 's a complex plot involving rivaling criminal gangs while the Aberdeen police force spend a rather exorbitant amount of money protecting a man newly released from prison after imprisoning and raping an older gentlemen ( though only convicted once , it is common knowledge that he is a serial offender )  . Many recurring characters appear here - even Colin Miller makes a cameo ! And there are several laugh-out-loud hilarious scenes of dialogue and banter ( many surrounding a new addition to the DS pool - Biohazard Bob ) . Logan himself continues to fall far from his once hero/goldenboy status . But even through his struggles and missteps , he remains a likable and sympathetic hero .

"Paroled rapist Richard Knox decides he wants to make a new life in the Aberdeen , forcing Granite Citys finest to protect him from an outraged populace . Meanwhile MacBride 's recurring hero DS Logan McRae is under the cosh from all directions : his superiors are overloading him and questioning his attitude ; hes hitting the drink increasingly hard ; hes spending more time before Professional Standards than dealing with his massive caseload packed with counterfeit money and goods , murder , flashers , and robbery ; and the local crime lord is leaving him envelopes of cash ... MacBrides touch for character interaction and team dynamics ( complete with realistic if coarse language and off-colour humour ) is once again to the fore , as he delivers another solid instalment in an excellent series . Readers cant help but feel for ( and follow ) beleaguered McRae , as he tries to weather the storms both natural and political , solve several cases , pull himself from his malaise , and decide if he even wants to remain a cop . Not the best in the series , but a good read nonetheless - with several ongoing issues between recurring characters moved forward ( or moved , anyway ) . I still miss DI Insch , but DI Steel is once again at her entertaining foul-mouthed best , McRae also has more to cope with in terms of his barely-competent colleague 'Beardy ' Beattie being promoted to DI ahead of him , and several other colourful characters are also introduced .

"A lackluster selection of audiobooks at my local library sent me back to Lackberg\ 's Fjallbacka series , one I had left for dead after the lackluster second book The Preacher and it\ 's multitude of boring , away-from-the-actual-murder-investigation nonsense . The third book in the series , The Stonecutter once again re-introduced main character Patrik\ 's fiancee into the main plotline , but she again fades to the background in this , the fourth episode . What I loved most about the first book in the series The Ice Princess was Erika\ 's involvement , as she was friends with the victim . When she is less involved in the investigation , the whole thing goes a little awry , as we are treated to long scenes that take away from the plot . Patrik is usually absent , so we get only odd vignettes of what his life must be like at home . Well , The Stranger has fixed a lot of those problems , and while Erika is one subplot , she\ 's not the only one . Melberg is the true star of the subplots here , and I love what they did with his character in this novel . I might just keep reading on , especially now that in the next episode , there promises to be more of the Erika and Patrik interaction that I loved about the first book . Note : this book also appears with the title The Gallows Bird , which is a terrible title .

"I know more about cancer than I ever . Although the book was very technical , even a non-medical person could understand it .",book,Positive
"The author of this excellent book thinks in monarchic terms . Cancer is the 'emperor ' of maladies . The historical starting point of the story is Queen Atossa , whose breast cancer also provides the theme for the book 's summary , a fast forward through the history of medical progress . A philosophical metaphor is provided by the great Red Queen : we need to run fast just to stay where we are . Progress requires running twice as fast . Ideology tends to corrupt . How does that insight relate to cancer ? Wars against cancer have been waged with big guns , but the first law of war was ignored for a long time : know your enemy . Who wants to read a 'biography of cancer ' ? Do n't we all know enough about it , be it by own direct experience , or by watching relatives and friends in their struggles ? I did n't feel much interested when this book became a non-fiction bestseller and award winner a few years ago . Something changed my mind , and I am glad . It is very good . There is a certain standard style in American non fiction , that sometimes turns me off . The writers must all have gone through the same school of 'creative writing ' . Subjects must be cut down into digestible pieces , the reader must be amused by anecdotes , almost at all cost . All this can only be tolerated when the book really has something to tell us . This one does . The manic diligence of surgeons in the early years of the 'war on cancer ' is as scary as the aggression of radiologists and chemotherapists . As is the neglect of prevention that ruled for a surprisingly long time . Much frenzy , hype , hope , and bitter disappointment has happened . The tide has possibly turned . Mortality moves down , gradually . All prongs contribute . Are we there yet ? Hardly . Geneticists are apparently making progress towards a better understanding of the biology of cancer . Some cures for specific cancers have actually been found , but the enemy keeps evolving . We need to run fast in order to stay in the same place , and even faster for progress . The red queen knew about that . The book has much to say on the politics of science and health care . The historical politicization of cancer research and therapy is striking and is one aspect that makes this book worth reading . Company decisions based on profitability , and strategy considerations do n't play as big a part in this story , as I would have expected . Anyway , better do n't catch it , even if your survival odds are getting better .","book--style, book--story, book, It","Negative, Negative, Mixed, Positive"

The only thing missing in those earlier days of research was applying nutrition , which is what generally cures cancer . The body must have nutrition in order to survive , heal itself , and thrive . If you also watch the history of modern medicine , it will help give a foundation for watching this Cancer flick . Now , in the present , nutrition has been added to support the conventional methods of cancer treatments . If you really want to add to your knowledge , go to natural news on the web . it shows the continuation of current methodologies for treating cancer . Enjoy .",biography,Positive

"The Alexander Cipher by Will Adams is an adventurous novel that has it all . Political machinations , ethnic strife , power-hungry corporate types , greedy antiquities dealers , mercenaries , sick children , desperate parents , brainy scientific types and beautiful women . Sort of like Matthew Reilly , but better edited , without all the damn italics and exclamation points ! ! ( Sorry , when I think Reilly , I think ! ! OH BOY ! ! Exclamation points ! ! ! ) But , I digress ...  . Will Adams debut novel features a sort of nere'do well Egyptologist that everyone seems to love to hate , Daniel Knox , whose life long interest in Alexander the Great puts him right in the thick of things when the novels bad guy..the slightly crazy and wildly wealthy Nicolas Dragoumis , learns of that Alexander 's tomb may have been discovered . Nicolas has some wacky belief that the tomb contains secrets and treasures that will cause Macedonia to become an independent state once more , and he has the wealth , power and obsession to see his beliefs through . Its up to our hero , Daniel , and of course , his newly discovered gorgeous sidekick , Gaille , to stop him and save the antiquities . ( Sort of like an Indiana Jones meets James Bond thing , but without MI-6 and spiffy weapons and toys . ) And of course , there is history between Gaille and Daniel that has to be resolved for their adventure to be a success . I 'm a bit of an ancient history buff , so I found the well-researched novel interesting , although occasionally confusing . There is a large cast of characters and apparently my old brain had a little trouble keeping up . Once I figured everyone out though , I really enjoyed the book . It 's a bit slow here and there , but overall , a good solid read .","read--characters, read","Negative, Mixed"
"I would pass this book on to my friends who own businesses and are aspiring to succeed . This book is written honestly , pointing out the parts that were sheer luck as well as what came by hard work and brains . If you are looking to build a serious team of people who 's main goal is to be the best , this is a great read .",read,Positive
