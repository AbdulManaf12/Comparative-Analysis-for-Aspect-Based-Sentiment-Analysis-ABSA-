Mean Eyed Cat has a neat history . The small wooden building located next to some train tracks is old and had been used as a chain saw repair shop for years . During the real estate boon of the early 2000s plans were made to tear it down to build condos . The owner of Mean Eyed Cat had a vision for this small place to be a bar dedicated to Johnny Cash ( this was before Cash had even passed away and before Walk the Line movie came out ) . He fought against the developers and soon the building was designated as historic preventing the tear down . From here Mean Eyed Cat ( the name of a Johnny Cash song that the owners dad used to sing to him ) was born . The owner 's dad died when he was 15 years old and he has remarked that the bar is as much as a memorial to his father as it is to Cash himself . The cool part about Mean Eyed Cat is that it is a bar dedicated to Johnny Cash but it is n't too much in your face . This is a theme that could be exploited to the nth degree but is n't . One of the big appeals of the place is the porch which has plenty of seating and good live bands . The inside of the bar is cozy but still a great place to have a beer . Some people complain about the fact that it is beer and wine only . This does n't bother me because they have my favorite beer ( Fireman # 4 ) on tap . Be aware that most of the selection of beer is going to be bottle . My friend is a wine girl and she enjoys the wine they offer . Mean Eyed Cat is also next door to Sushi Zushi which has a great happy hour . You should eat some happy hour sushi then walk next door to Mean Eyed cat for beer and music . There is a free parking garage connecting these two establishments which has plenty of free parking .,"Mean Eyed cat, Mean Eyed cat--Fireman # 4, Mean Eyed cat--free parking, Mean Eyed cat--place, Mean Eyed cat--porch--seating, Sushi Zushi--happy hour, Sushi Zushi--free parking, Mean Eyed cat--porch, Mean Eyed cat--porch--live bands, Sushi Zushi--happy hour sushi","Positive, Positive, Positive, Positive, Positive, Positive, Positive, Positive, Positive, Positive",Restaurant
"My family and I decided to go to Johnny Carino\ 's because we hadn\'t been there in awhile . The last time we were there I was disappointed because they no longer serve the lobster ravioli but I figured we would give them another try . I regret that decision . First of all the entire restaurant was hot as if the AC was not fully working . It took 35 minutes to get our food and my plate was wrong . They asked me if it was okay '' . I didn\'t send it back because I was starving and we needed to eat quickly and leave because we had waited so long and out children were getting cranky . Then the waiter proceeds to put a hot bowl of spaghetti on the table directly in front of my 10 month old and he put his hand in it . It didn\'t burn him but it was hot enough to make him cry . The waiter obviously lacked common sense . The food was not very good either . Needless to say , we will find another restaurant the next time we are in the mood for Italian .","restaurant--waiter, restaurant, restaurant--food","Negative, Negative, Negative",Restaurant

"My husband and I ordered two sabich pitas for dinner and we loved it ! The pita bread was a lovely texture and flavor , and the fried eggplant and hard-boiled egg combo was so satisfying . I loved all the crunchy fresh lettuce and pickles too -- these were really necessary foils to the creamy labne , nutty tahini , and hearty eggplant and hard-boiled egg . The only downside was that the bottom of the pita became a little soggy , so I would suggest putting a thinner layer of labne and maybe line the bottom with some lettuce to prevent this .","hearty eggplant, hard-boiled egg, sabich pitas, pita bread--texture, pickles, nutty tahini, creamy labne, pita bread--flavor, lettuce, fried eggplant and hard-boiled egg combo, pita--bottom","Positive, Positive, Positive, Positive, Positive, Positive, Positive, Positive, Positive, Positive, Negative",Restaurant

"Yes , I havent reviewed in forever . But , this experience made me dust off the old password and write . My boyfriend and I decided to try something new and venture outside our comfort zone . We had heard of the draw of Oakhurst and we wanted pizza . Should have consulted yelp before the 30 min car ride . We sat outside thanks to a nice day and were greeted a few minutes later ( btw we arrived around 1:45 and there were exactly 3 other tables / noted when I was annoyed later ) . We decided to order slices . Boyfriend wanted marinara on his slice and I wanted to try the garlic white cream sauce on my slice..glub , blub . First our waiter tells us that it will take longer to make a slice of marinara that we should order a pie or he should get the white sauce . Boyfriend goes with white sauce . What kind of pizza place does n't have marinara ready to go ? ? ? 20 minutes later , waiter says they can now do marinara would Boyfriend like to go with the original order ? Sure if it 's not going to be much longer . 1 table left around us that has already eaten . Finally , 15 minutes later Boyfriend gets his slice of pizza with marinara . 5 minutes later my slice arrives without the white garlic sauce I was coveting but with marinara . What exactly happened for two slices of pizza to take close to a hour and a half . The reason I am giving this place two stars is because the pizza was pretty good and the neighborhood seemed cool . Was it worth the gas and time for TWO slices of pizza and one of which being incorrectly prepared ?

"I cant understand the vast number of mid to low star reviews about this place . I have been a fan of the original Holeman and Finch Public House for the past several years , and I can say that the burger they serve at PCM is just as good . Sure you 're paying a premium price for all the quality that goes into making it ... fresh baked buns from their own bakery , freshly ground beef of 50/50 chuck and brisket , homemade B & B pickles which stand apart from any other pickle , and homemade ketchup and mustard that are to die for . Also keep in mind that almost every vendor at PCM is expensive compared to a normal fast food joint ... paying $ 12 for a quality burger is nothing to scoff about in a high end shopping center of Atlanta . That being said , the fries are nothing to get excited over ... they 're definitely good , but not outstanding . And from what I 've seen the shakes are a little small for $ 6 . But we 're talking Burger 's here . I 've been to the other highly praised burger places in Atlanta ; Fred 's @ Krog Street Market , The Vortex , Illegal Food ( which does a larger variant of the H & F Burger ) , and Anne 's snack shack ... and while each offers something a little more unique ... none of them really capture the essence of a quality classic Double Cheeseburger like H & F .

"Hmm what can I say but a little disappointed with this place . First of all when I go out and spend over $ 100 on a meal I do not want to feel rushed . We were sat , had three items and was scooted out in 45 mins . Not only did we feel rushed the food wasnt even that good . I had a beet salad to start which was probably the best thing I had . Then we had an appetizer which was a thin piece of meat , a little bit of arugula and a tsp of arugula pur\xc3\xa9e ... No good , finally had the steak which was just fair nothing to write home about . With all the great reviews I saw I was going in for a great dinner . Not sure were these people normally eat that think it 's so good but maybe they should try some new places .

"My First time in there last night ( April 16 , 2015 ) and service was not great ! ! ! There was about 10-12 of us there for two birthday celebration . The male bartender was good but the female waitress with short black hair was very , very , very rude and bitchy ! ! ! I mostly sat at the bar ( sober all night as I\ 'm the DD ) chatting with friends and people watching . This is what I experienced ... ..We were standing around in groups chatting , female waitress with her irritated voice you either move to a side or keep a gap in between you guys so I can get by ! '' If it was a really really packed place , she would be maneuvering her way thru everyone to get where she needed to be . When she brought my food , no eye contact , no smile , no `` can I get you anything else '' or even a `` you\ 're welcome '' after I said `` thank you '' . The food was good . She ignored me when I was trying to get her attention for ranch and ketchup as she walked by . But she was very friendly to the locals next to me . As the night went by , she happens to walk by in the middle of a smart ass comment from one of my friend `` I just downed half a bottle of fireball in the bathroom ! '' She said `` get the fuck out , now I\ 'm gon na have to clean that up in there ! '' Then she said something to the male bartender and next thing we got kicked out for joking around amongst ourselves . We didn\'t bring any liquor in to the bar , we ordered fireball shots and other alcohol drinks at the bar . My fianc\xc3\xa9 went to talk to her in a calm manner but she told him to `` Fuck Off . '' There was no reasoning with them as to why we were getting kicked out , the male bartender could only say `` we had other people bringing in alcohol , she has been here since 4pm ( it was only 10:45pm , not even a full 8hrs shift she had and not a lot of customers ) , I am sorry . '' If she hadn\'t walked into a middle of a conversation amongst friends joking around and having fun , we would not have gotten kicked out . We weren\'t been obnoxious , picking fights or bringing outside alcohol ! ! I guess if you are not a local there , enter at your own risk . It\ 's kinda sad not wanting to support local small bars when you have a horrible experience your first time there and/or going back with friends that live in that neighborhood . I hope that waitress changes her attitude , not a people person and/or if you don\'t like your work find something else .

My favorite is the roast beef which is sliced to order and SO good ! You can order any sub `` Mike\ 's Way '' which basically means everything on it , including oil & vinegar & spices -- YUM ! Definitely recommend this ! There\ 's also a sweet-spicy pepper relish that\ 's good on everything . I usually order it on the side so it\ 's not too overwhelming . The bread here is fresh baked , though they only offer white or wheat , and don\'t have a toaster so don\'t expect grilled or hot toasted bread ... but when they have the parmesan rosemary bread , get it ! And their wheat bread is really good ... it is light and satisfying enough for those who prefer white bread . The only thing I would NOT order again is the chicken parm sub . It is GROSS . I don\'t think they should even offer this sub if they\ 're not going to commit to making it delicious . The marinara sauce is bland and not that warm , the bread isn\'t toasted and becomes soggy very quickly , the breading on the chicken is soggy and bland , and the chicken itself seems to be chicken `` fingers '' formed from pieces of white meat rather than actual whole chicken breast . It was really an abomination and honestly makes me a little queasy to think about it . I don\'t think this is an issue with this location , but the overall chain ...

"Im writing this with a full belly , and burning mouth . My brother , cousin and I were trying to decide where to eat on this lovely Sunday . It was a toss-up between here and Pho Van , which , if you have read my review on Pho Van , you know that it is hard for me to turn down a bowl of pho tai . But , I am happy to say , I had a wonderful experience today . First of all , the staff is incredibly nice . We were sat quickly , and after we ordered , everything came out within 10 minutes . I had the beef noodle soup , the Thai equivalent to pho . It was damn tasty , they use more spices than it 's vietnamese relative . More cilantro , and they add crispy garlic on top , nice little surprise . And of course , I doused that mother with sambal ( pretty much my favorite condiment , I should probably start carrying around a jar in my purse ) . My brother and cousin both got different curry 's , and they loved them . I tried a bit of both , one was a jungle curry ( spicy ) and one was coconut milk based ( sweet/slight spice ) , both were yummy . My only complaint : I would have liked a slice of lime for my soup .

Nevertheless , I think I have to write something about this suckers ...  . oh ... no hooters restaurant . I always enjoy the chicken wings at hooters . I eat at at least 3 different hooters this year . This one , located at orlando , is the worst one I have ever made . First , I arrived Orlando around 11:40 , and I give a call before I go there restaurant . The waitress told me that they are still open and I gladly to drive there in 10 minutes . While I arrived , she asked us to have a seat , and 5 mins later a waitress come and said : We are going to close after 2 minutes . What you can eat and finish quickly ? '' . I\ 'm angry , but I\ 'm hungry either . I reluctantly said : `` fine , please give me a to-go order for 20 pcs of chicken wings '' . Come on , you should close the door or tell your customer if you don\'t want to server them even they come before you close , right ? Not to mention I call before I go there . But this is not the worst . She suggested me to give her more tips even I only have a to-go orders . What ? Why ? I don\'t get any service at to-go order . She shows her detesting face and not even a `` thanks '' when we left . The worst is ... . I went back my hotel and open my to-go box . They only put 13pcs in my box but not 20pcs . I paid the price for 20 but they only give me 13 , with lots of fried pieces which look like leftover . I won\'t recommend anyone to this restaurant .

"Was staying at the Hilton during a conference and ate here 3 times . Eating here that many times not really by choice but more a matter of convenience . With 95+ degree heat and the weird parking logistics the hotel takes more effort than it should to leave . All three meals disappointing . I wont go through each . The menu is modern which is fine but frankly almost too modern . Every item has some eccentric twist . It would be good to have basic comfort or traditional options . For instance.. Pizza , they have 3 options . Egg & chorizo ( seriously ? ) , bbq chicken ( no BBQ sauce and grilled chicken smothered heavily with some sort of ranch sauce ) , and margherita . So those are your 3 . That night I just wanted something simple . I noticed on the kids menu they have pepperoni pizza . Asked my server if I could simply get a pepperoni pizza and was told no . I pointed out that it is available for kids and my request was pretty simple , heck just add it to the basic cheese pizza . Still told no . So I begrudgingly go with the BBQ . Worst thing ever ( reference why above ) . Lady at the table next to me sees it and tells me she is jealous . I gave her a slice ( never done that before but why not I do n't want it ) . The look of mild disgust on her face matched mine . I paid and left saying no to the box . The last night there was with 2 friends and planned to try the steakhouse on the property but it was closed for a private party . Again forced over to David 's .

First I should mention that I went to the canteen at Jamestown/IDB on drydock ave and not the food truck .

"I work on Peachtree so I have been to Hooters several times . This particular review is in association with a visit I had in relation to a promotion for their new smoked wings that I received for being a BzzAgent product reviewer . The service at lunchtime is typically slower than you\ 'll find at other restaurants up and down Peachtree . The servers are friendly but not very attentive . Happy Hour is even worse . Anyways , I ordered the smoked wings and informed the waitress that I had a coupon that I\ 'd like to use , so as to not surprise her after the meal . I was informed that she wasn\'t sure if the coupon was accepted at this location and wouldn\'t know until it was time to get the check ... what ? Soooo I\ 'm ordering something that I specifically came here for because I have a coupon but you won\'t tell me if the coupon is good until after I\ 've ordered and consumed said food ? Weird , but whatever , I need to eat regardless of the coupon . We waited for what seemed like an incredibly long time just to get our food . It didn\'t seem that busy , usual lunch crowd and we even make a point to try and go to lunch before noon so as to avoid the large chunk of the lunch crowd . Anyways , the food arrived , and was hot which was nice . It did not spent much time under the lamps at least . The wings themselves were pretty good . They would have been better had they been dipped in some sort of sauce or something after being smoked . The resulting finish on the wings was very dry and there was an abundance of flaky '' seasoning which would break off on its own in your mouth . I accidentally almost inhaled one of these pieces and had a brief coughing fit . Beyond that , the flavor itself was delicious . The smokiness wasn\'t overbearing , the seasoning tasted good . The wings were well cooked and as I said before , they came out hot . I ordered a side of dipper fries as well , but those were gross . They tasted like they were frozen too long and seemed stale . Over-all the service is nothing special , the servers are friendly but not attentive . The food was decent , the wings themselves were quite good , although dry because of the fact that they\ 're smoked wings and not fried .

"I just moved from Scituate to right near the Hingham Shipyard , so I was thrilled when they announced a restaurant similar to Galley ( in Scituate ) was coming to the Shipyard . My husband and I went for lunch the first week they were open , and it was OK , but the menu was minimal , the service was slow , and the sandwiches werent worth the money . We figured it was their first week , and they 'd get better . And the chicken sandwich was good enough that my 7-month-pregnant self craved it . So we went for lunch last week to give it another try . I forgot that the sandwich was $ 16 ( ! ! ) until we got there , but again , cravings are cravings ! We sat at the bar , only 3 other groups in the restaurant , and the menu is still small so it took us 2 seconds to look at it . But then we sat there waiting to order for 10 minutes . Finally we order , and then wait , and wait , and wait for 30 minutes for 2 sandwiches to come out . Again , 3 groups in the restaurant , and they are SANDWICHES ! When my chicken sandwich came out 30 minutes later , I luckily gave it a quick look before scarfing it down , because the chicken was RAW . I freaked out . Being pregnant , touching raw chicken , I was skeeved . I sent it back and was tempted to just leave , but at that point I was absolutely starving , did n't have enough time to go somewhere else before heading back to work , so they took it back , and brought me a whole new plate maybe 10 minutes later . It was good , but I was seriously just grossed out at that point . And no , they did n't take anything off the bill ... I gave them the benefit of the doubt their first week because I figured they were getting their act together . But weeks into business , to serve a raw chicken sandwich to a pregnant person after having them wait 40 minutes to order and get their food when the restaurant is basically empty , I just ca n't trust that they 'll ever get their act together . As much as I love Galley and Bia , Trident is a major disappointment .","Trident--chicken sandwich, Galley and Bia, Trident--chicken sandwich--chicken, plate, Trident--service, Trident--menu, Trident, Trident--sandwiches","Mixed, Positive, Negative, Mixed, Negative, Negative, Mixed, Negative",Restaurant
