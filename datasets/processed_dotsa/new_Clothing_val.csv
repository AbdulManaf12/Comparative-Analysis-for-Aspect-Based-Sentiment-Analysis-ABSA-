"These are dance shoes , so expect them to fit at least a size smaller than street shoes . So if you wear a 7 , try an 8 .  these are required for a high school choir my daughter is in , so she won\'t be wearing them much and no real dancing . We are familiar with dance shoes so we knew to size up . Quality is okay . Not the best quality leather , but they are pretty well made , so they will last through a dance season if you are taking a class , and probably much longer depending on use . The Size Question amazon asked stated too small as the only option that made sense , but the aren\'t really too small - you just have to know that dance shoes are always at least a size smaller than street shoes - sometimes even two sizes . So if you know that , they fit fine . In our case , these fit by sizing up one size for someone with a narrow foot . If you have a wide foot , you may need to go up more than one size .",shoes,Positive
These shoes work really well if you 're going to walk a lot . They can be dressed up or down ; wear them with shorts or a Summer dress . Mine were very true to size . They are a nice dark navy color .,"shoes--size, shoes, shoes--color","Positive, Positive, Positive"
"Usually Gloria Vanderbilt runs small on me , so I ordered a size up . I really like the shirt , but it 's too big . I 'm returning it for a smaller size .",shirt,Mixed
The shirt was as I expected . It is a good shirt for the price and does not need ironing if pulled out when the drier is done . It shrunk slightly when I washed it per the label in cold water . I tried the next size up on at a local store and it was way to big . Oder your size . It expect some shrinkage .,"shirt, shirt--price","Mixed, Positive"

Perfect . Follow the capezio size chart and you 're in the clear . I like these better than the footless ones because I can choose either way . I practice modern and ballet and aerial . It 's good to wear and be able to slip into cute shoes after .

"First I LOVE THESE TIGHTS ! ! ! Beats pantyhose hands down , and they 're DURABLE . I 'm active , and usually get runs in pantyhose the first day . These I 've worn several times now , and not a hint of bagginess and not one teensy run . I 'm HAPPY ! I love the shimmer -- and I love the TOAST color , as I have pasty white legs . My only complaint -- according to the size chart , I should have fit into a size A ( small ) . They easily stretched wide enough , but not long enough . The crotch rode a bit low , which was irritating . I gave them to my super-petite daughter , and she loves them . I loved them enough to get size B , and they 're PERFECT . I 've since ordered extras so that I will always look spiffy and polished in my Sunday best .","TIGHTS, TIGHTS--crotch rode, TIGHTS--shimmer, TIGHTS--TOAST color, TIGHTS--size chart","Mixed, Negative, Positive, Positive, Negative"

"I do n't usually purchase shoes on line , as it is difficult to find shoes that fit properly . However , I decided to try this pair and was very pleased with the fit and the style . Also , the very first day I wore them there was no break in period . They were comfortable all day long . I like them so much that I bought two more pairs - one in navy and another in black .

"These tights are very comfortable and pretty . I\ 'm not a dancer , so I\ 'm not sure what a transition tight is or the purpose of the hole in the bottom is , but it doesn\'t bother me at all .

Wonderfully soft . The only caveat is that the sole is not as wide as the 4E width of the shoe so I can feel the edges of the sole under my feet when I 'm walking .,shoe--sole,Negative
"I really like the sandals . They appear to be well made plus they are comfortable . They were a little too large , but the next size smaller would have been too short . I just put a gel cushion inside that made them just right . I have a high arch and they give good support for my feet . They really look pretty on my feet . I 've only worn them for a short period because where I live it 's a little too cold right now for sandals . I do look forward to wearing them when the weather turns warmer . I might even buy another pair in a different color .",sandals,Mixed

"Nice quality , attractive , light weight , and just what I wanted , BUT . . . if you normally wear a wide width , either try the extra wide in this sandal or simply don\'t bother . A 6 . 5 wide usually fits beautifully in any shoe . I wore these around the office for a bit to see if they would stretch , but it just didn\'t happen . The marks left on my feet are atrocious . I\ 'm not reordering in extra wide as I don\'t want to have to return a second pair .",quality,Positive

"This company provides a great little crinoline for the price . I will agree I was a little dismayed when I took it out of the package because it was very flat . I remember pressing crinolines however in my youth and once I pressed the layers out , it easily doubled in fullness . I just ordered a second because I have a dress for a Malt Shop cruise that I want to be really poofy . Don\'t let the price or negative reviews sway you .

"I usually do n't but tights online for my daughter for dance , but made an exception this time because amazon had a much better price than the local dance shop . I followed the Capezio size guide and these were very small on my daughter . As they are transition tights , she could pull the feet up and use them with her foot undeez , but they were too small to wear over her feet for her other dance shoes . I ended up having to go to the dance shop and buy another pair for recital , but these were fine for practicing . Just ... ALWAYS SIZE UP . I know that is common knowledge with dance gear and especially capezio ... so that is what I did and they were still too small . Quality was good , price was good , next time I will order larger and way earlier so I can avoid being gouged by the dance shop .","transition tights--Quality, transition tights--price, transition tights","Positive, Positive, Mixed"
"Love it ! I got the baby pink and it 's such a beautiful color ! I love oversized sweatshirts for cooler days , and this one is very comfortable and lightweight for those cooler spring days .

Will probably be getting the baby blue in the near future .","sweatshirt, sweatshirt--color","Positive, Positive"

Now , if I can just drop down a size so I can also dance more often as well . Even with out that , they make you feel like your dancing when your just walking around .","product--color, product","Negative, Mixed"

"I love this shoe . It 's dressy , but casual enough for every day summer wear , and it 's comfortable for walking around every day . I bought one years ago at a retail store , then when they started breaking down I tried to find another shoe that fit the casual-dressy-comfortable category and could n't find anything else that came close .

"I bought a L/XL . I am 114lbs 5\ ' 7 . They\ 're generally a good fit , as they stretch a bit after you wear them . It was a little scary pulling them on the first time though as I thought they weren\'t going to fit . I rated this product as somewhat small because that\ 's how I\ 'd describe the fit on me , but I would have never thought I needed a L/XL without first checking the size chart on Capezio\ 's website .","product--size chart, product","Negative, Mixed"

"I have n't yet danced in them , but they seem much more durable than my other pair of tights . I ordered a S/M when I should have ordered a M/L , but they fit quite well save the waist elastic ( which I will be adjusting ) . Be aware , the color is very vibrant . I 'm hoping they fade slightly after some washes .","tights, tights--color","Mixed, Negative"
"I love these tights ! They provide good coverage , this is my second pair ( unfortunately they are n't hole proof ! ) The small seem a bit large . I 'm 110 lbs and only 5 ' and the waist band to fit my legs properly is worn as high as my waist . Other than that these are the best ! ! !",tights,Mixed
"So I was n't sure at all of these would be a good idea to wear to the office when I ordered . I was looking for something to replace my pantyhose because no matter what brand I buy I manage to have a run by the end of the day . I have much better luck with tights , but needed something that could serve the purpose of pantyhose on my closet . Ladies , I think I 've found it ! These are n't sparkly , they 're shimmery , which makes my legs look amazing . Paired with professional office attire , you can really pull these off in the office . The only things to note are , they are a bit darker than I anticipated with an ever so slight lean towards pink . I bought classic light toast , I 'll be ordering a second pair in just light toast to better fit my skin tone ( super pale ) and they run a little small in the hips , so getting a size up in my opinion is a good idea . Overall , I 'm super happy so far !",pantyhose,Negative

must be seconds quality because they are way short in the waist and way long in the leg ... .. weird .,quality,Negative
"The product arrived as specified and shipped within the agreed time . I always order 1 size more , so it fit as expected .",product,Positive
"These tights are a lovely shade of ballet pink , and the material is thick and looks like it will hold up well with repeated washing . But they have one major flaw : the waistband is way too tight . I always buy tights one size larger than the manufacturer recommends , so I first purchased these in Large/XL . They fit nicely except for the extremely tight waistband . Since I was impressed with the quality of the material , I decided I\ 'd go up one more size and try the XXL . Unfortunately , the waistband in the XXL was still much too tight . For reference , I am about 5\ ' 7 and 135 # , and I usually wear a size 4-6 in ladies\ ' skirts and pants . If Capezio fixed the waistband , these would be perfect . I will probably wear them until they wear out since they were fairly expensive , but I\ 'll most likely buy more of the Theatricals XL tights ( which are lower quality but half the price and more comfortable ) when I need new ones .","Theatricals XL tights--price, tights--material, tights--waistband, Theatricals XL tights--quality, tights--material--quality, Theatricals XL tights","Positive, Positive, Negative, Mixed, Mixed, Mixed"

"These boots look fantastic but as the saying goes , you get what you pay for . I tried on a different make of boot that looked identical but cost $ 350 and they fit so well and felt amazing on my feet . I can already tell the left boot fits different than the right and has a spot that is rubbing into the ankle . I 'm a tall lean guy but the tops of the boots are very wide . Even if you had calves like Schwarzenegger they would be too big . I tried wearing them with straight leg pants ( not jeans ) and they bulge out making the leg look disproportionate . All this being said , I 'll just have to wear the right pants and only wear them for a few hours at a time ( no line dancing ) and if I follow that routine I 'll get my $ 140 out of them .","boots, boots--tops of the boots","Mixed, Negative"

I like the shoes very much . They are comfortable and flexible as well as stylish . I do wish they had a little more cushioning in them . Overall I think they are a very good fit and would like to see them in more colors .,shoes,Mixed
Beautiful shoe . Only problem is that it was too large . Usually I wear a 6 in this brand but this particular style is generously sized . I had to order the size smaller ( it fit beautifully ) .,shoe,Mixed
"This top is great , especially for such a low price . It is chambray , and is thin but durable . The color is exactly as shown in the photos . The ribbing on the sides of the shirt looks nice in person and adds a somewhat more unique flair to a basic closet staple . The buttons are fine and not loose at all , but my shirt did come with an extra button just in case . Follow the washing instructions exactly ! This shirt will bleed color onto your other clothing items , so do n't let it get wet around white/light colored items . My biggest complaint with this shirt is that the listing , when I purchased it , did not specify that the sleeve length when fully extended was only 3/4th sleeves . So at their longest , they come just past my elbows ( I have long arms ) , and when rolled up , it is a short sleeve shirt . It would have been nice to know this before purchasing the shirt . But it 's still such a bargain that I did not return it . It still looks nice , but if you want a full length sleeve chambray shirt , search elsewhere ! !","shirt--price, shirt--buttons, shirt--sleeve, shirt, shirt--ribbing","Positive, Positive, Negative, Mixed, Positive"

"These are supposed to be wide width , however , the only wide part is the sole . The area across the top of the foot is very tight . There 's little space between the sole and the band .

"These are a great cherry red color and I think would be very comfortable if they fit because they have very soft wide toe straps . The heel is very slight and they felt like cushiony flats , which I liked . However I had to return them because they were a bit too wide . I wear a fairly true 9 . 5 Narrow in a closed toe shoe . Reviews said length was true to size which I agree with . These were not narrow in the toe area and my foot slipped around enough that I was n't comfortable keeping them .
