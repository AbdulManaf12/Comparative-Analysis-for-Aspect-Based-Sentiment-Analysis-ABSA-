"Tiffany 's apartment is really special . First it is in the best location in Boston , steps from the common and in the center of everything you might want to see or do in the city . I was there for a conference in the Seaport district and enjoyed the 15 minute walk in the morning and afternoon . The building itself is beautiful and feels like old new england . The lofted bed was a fun experience and the TV with an apple tv was perfect for relaxing evenings . I look forward to returning .","building--lofted bed--TV, building, building--lofted bed, building--location","Positive, Positive, Positive, Positive"

"The arrival and self check-in could not have been easier -- my arrival was a breeze , and the room was clean and ready . I especially appreciated the luggage stand -- a rare find in an AirBNB . The bathroom was spotless and beautiful , and the fridge a convenient addition . Although the oblivious guest in the adjacent room was rather obnoxiously loud the first night of my stay ( from 10pm to past midnight ) , Todd quickly addressed the situation the next morning . While `` meditation room '' is n't the first label I would think to give this listing ( there is also a major construction project at Harvard going on , not too far away ) , I imagine this room is a generally pleasant and good option with the right neighbor .","arrival, Todd, meditation room, fridge, self check-in, luggage stand, bathroom","Positive, Positive, Positive, Positive, Positive, Positive, Positive"

The bed is comfortable and the sofa bed is sufficient . The location is very convenient for the Hynes ( only 2 minutes walk ) and for shopping if desired . The metro stop is about 5 minutes stroll away . Only complaints are the relatively slow internet connection , light sleet noise , and lack of basic toiletries . This was mentioned in the description , so it 's no surprise . This is a great alternative to a hotel for business travelers , and those that do not require the personal touch of staying in someone else 's home .","Everything--sleet noise, Everything--sofa bed, Everything--basic toiletries, Everything--location, Everything, Everything--bed, Everything--door access, Everything--internet connection","Negative, Positive, Negative, Positive, Mixed, Positive, Positive, Negative"

"This was my first time staying in a room in someone else 's home . The layout of the townhouse afforded us privacy , though Penny made it clear that my sister and I were welcome to move about as we needed , and we felt very at home . Penny provided breakfast items , including coffee , muffins and fresh fruit , which we enjoyed on her sweet back patio one of our two mornings . The room is as described , with a lovely view through the tall windows and trees . The bed was very comfortable , the house and neighborhood were quiet and we slept very well both nights . The house is located in a great neighborhood , full of shops and restaurants within an easy walk . Penny informed us of the art festival going on the weekend we were there and we were able to enjoy a bit of it . We wished we 'd had more time ! We had a family member at Brigham and Women 's Hospital , which was a very short drive away . The house is close to many Boston destinations , yet still reasonably priced . Despite its central location , the townhouse is located in a little hidden area that you would n't otherwise notice ( we thought we were turning into an alley when we first turned onto Penny 's street ) . It was so great to be a bit off the beaten path , in such a bustling city - to be both in the thick of things , and have shady seclusion and quiet at the same time .

"Great space and great location ! I had to fly into Boston last minute for work and did n't want to charge $ 500+ to the company for one hotel stay . I was pleasantly surprised to stumble on Tiffany 's listing . The space is a small lofted studio that 's kept neat and in a secured building . The location literally could n't be better - just a block away from Boston Commons and walking distance to literally anything else in the city you wish to see . The place is clean and cozy . Loved having Netflix and Hulu available while I was preparing for my early morning meeting the next day . I was also able to order dinner and have it delivered through Seamless very easily as well . My next trip to Boston I 'd be hard-pressed to stay anywhere else because for the price , cleanliness and location I do n't think Tiffany 's place can be beat !","Tiffany 's place--Netflix and Hulu, Tiffany 's place--cleanliness, Tiffany 's place, Tiffany 's place--location, Tiffany 's place--price, Tiffany 's place--Seamless","Positive, Positive, Positive, Positive, Positive, Positive"

"This stay was one of the best Air Bnb experiences I have had . The room is as it is described , with a very comfortable bed and plenty of space for luggage . There are many additional touches which only add to the experience . On occasional nights , the noise from the airport can be quite loud , but earplugs are provided which dampen out the sound considerably . The provision of breakfast was very welcome , and Valerie is an excellent baker ! In terms of location , the house is ideally located for visiting the main sites and central Boston - a 10 minute walk to the airport station which takes you to the city in a couple of stops . Valerie and Jason were exceptionally kind and hospitable throughout and I definitely recommend this stay !","house, house--room--bed, house--location, house--Valerie, house--room--space, house--breakfast, house--Jason","Positive, Positive, Positive, Positive, Positive, Positive, Positive"

I would stay here again if we return to Boston . Also , noted that the loft bed is really cozy , comfortable and the whole apt . had a great layout and design .

"Gloria made the check in process extremely easy - she was kind enough to meet one of my roommates early at the coffee house across the street from the house so that she could give keys and a tour of the space , which was extremely appreciated . The description was accurate , and the neighborhood was beyond wonderful - one block from Charles Street , and less than 0 . 6 miles from the theatre where we were working for 2 weeks . Some of the furniture in the house 's common areas could be updated , but it was totally adequate for our needs , along with a very comfy couch in front of the HDTV , which we enjoyed for Netflix nights .","house--couch, house--check in, house--neighborhood, house--Gloria, furniture, house--Gloria--description","Positive, Positive, Positive, Positive, Positive, Positive"
"The Meditation Room is a beautiful oasis that is well cared for by the host and the cleaning staff . We were there to race in the Head of the Charles rowing regatta , the biggest rowing regatta in the world outside of the Olympics ! Its close proximity to the river and finish line venue makes it an ideal location for future athletes . Everything about our stay went without a hitch *until* I lost our key . I lost our key and I contacted the host same-day at 6pm both through the AirBnB communication system and directly by text message to notify him ( I have saved transcripts and screenshots of both conversation portals ) . We were unable to lock our door and secure our belongings to safely leave the room located within a shared guest space . The host informed us of a hidden spare key for our door , however the key did not match this lock and it was not functional . By 11:07pm , 5 hours after my first request for assistance , with the situation still not resolved and the host very slow to respond to all communications , the host insisted the hidden key was the correct key , and that `` I ca n't get a new key to you at this hour . '' I sent him a video of the hidden key not working in our room door lock . I offered to come directly to him or to his house cleaners who live close by but did not receive any reply that evening , nor did I hear from him the next day by checkout . Complete communication blackout . What if we were actually locked out of the room ? By the time we were ready to check out the next day , we spoke with the cleaning crew who had dealt with a similar situation in the past and would have been happy to assist , however they were never notified . We were surprised about this entire poor communication experience , given the excellent reviews for Todd and the listing . Todd 's cleaning crew is top notch , the location is both beautiful and walking distance to Harvard and the Charles River . Enjoy your stay , and we hope that communication is more efficient and helpful for you ... . and do n't lose your key .","host--communication, Meditation Room, Meditation Room--host, Meditation Room--location, host--communications, Meditation Room--Todd 's cleaning crew, Meditation Room--cleaning staff","Negative, Positive, Mixed, Positive, Negative, Positive, Positive"
