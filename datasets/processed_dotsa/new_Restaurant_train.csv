"Good ol country BBQ joint . Portion sizes could have been a little larger , but did come for lunch off the lunch menu . Sloppy pork playe with baked beans and baked potato were good . BE ADVISED - if you are a large person , they have no chairs , only fixed booth seating . Otherwise , service and food was great .","country BBQ joint, country BBQ joint--food, country BBQ joint--Sloppy pork playe with baked beans, country BBQ joint--service, country BBQ joint--baked potato","Positive, Positive, Positive, Positive, Positive",Restaurant
I liked the variety of doughnut options with both traditional and nontraditional flavors . I also liked the high energy atmosphere with the friendly staff and trendy music . The reason I took a star off is because of the 4 different types I tired they all seemed like a harder cake doughnut and were not hot ( I guess thats how they are supposed to be ? ) . Also the line was very long ( taking about 20 minutes ) and the building has next to no seating . You basically have to get your food and go .,"atmosphere, variety of doughnut options, staff, music","Positive, Positive, Positive, Positive",Restaurant
"There are so many different places to choose from in Boston but Paddy Os is by far the best ! This bar is spacious with good music , good food ( burgers are great ! ) drinks are reasonably priced and to top it off they have an amazing staff . Angela and Nigel are two of the nicest , funniest , most personable bar tenders I have ever met along with their manager Theo . Thank you to this wonderful staff for making my stay in Boston a trip to remember .

Stopped in to this little gem of a restaurant hidden in the industrial area close to olympic village . Ordered the filet mignon and the leeks & cream pasta . Both were done to perfection with an amazing attention to detail and quality . Ingredients are top shelf and pasta is homemade daily . Finished up with the pavlova which was amazing in its own right . Light airy meringue and rich vanilla whipped cream combined to finally throw me into a full on food coma . The prices for this quality of food are amazingly low . It should also be mentioned that their bartender Grant makes a damn near perfect whiskey sour which happens to be one of my vices . Great value .

That being said , if you are in Atlanta it 's a nice 'neighborhoody ' place to visit with tasty food/drinks and friendly , personal service .

"The Florentine Cafe is at best a mediocre restaurant , but a fabulous bar ! My wife and I went for lunch this weekend , as we often find ourselves wandering around the North End at two or three oclock in the afternoon looking for a late lunch/early dinner . We ordered some Bruschetta as an appetizer , and it was pretty much just some italian bread with tomatoes and cheese , nothing inspired , but just fine if you 're looking for a nosh with your drinks . I ordered the Pollo Fra Diavolo and was rather disappointed - the sauce was greasy and lacked flavor and pizazz - though it did have a slight kick it was nothing like the fiery goodness of a really good diavolo sauce . My wife chose the salmon risotto and it was similarly underwhelming , an utterly uninteresting piece of grilled salmon ( tasted like it was n't seasoned at all ) and a big blop of mostly flavorless creamy rice . What saved this place from a two star review was my mixed drink - I had the Florentine Cosmopolitan ( Who says guys ca n't drink a cosmo ? : ) and it was fabulous . Beautifully blended flavors that went down very smooth . This place just radiates neighborhood charm , the recent restoration efforts have really paid off .

"This review is for the Seattles Best upstairs . Like another reviewer noted , this is a great space to retreat away off the beaten path of the hectic shoppers . Totally different vibe from the Starbucks in the middle of the mall . If you are lucky you can score a table by the window and catch up with a friend , chill by yourself while reading a book or hooking up your laptop . Unfortunately , there was one counter person and two people in front of me so it was a slow ordering process . While I waited I was reading up on their different levels of coffee on their board and decided mine would be Level 5 . When I ordered a medium the girl looked at me like I was an alien and I said is that not the brewed coffee on your menu ? She said they were only brewing Level 1 . What ?

"This is my first time ordering from this restaurant . I dont usually write a review until at least the second or third visit but I changed my mind today . My order was to-go , delivered by UberEATS . When I placed the order , it said I 'd receive it within 30 minutes , which I did . The food arrived warm , and looked great even in a to-go container . They even wrote nice thank you notes on each container which I thought was adorable and very sweet . The first item ordered was the Liege ( Belgium ) waffle . They were kind enough to provide both the white chocolate lavender sauce and the sweet-salty-spicy dulce de l\xc3\xa8che as I requested in the special instructions , and at no charge ( but I would 've gladly paid ) . Both sauces were A M A Z I N G ! The lightly infused lavender was a pleasant surprise as I was expecting either too much lavender , or not to even notice it , maybe even that I might not care for it . On the contrary , I may even borrow this idea from them lol . The dulce de l\xc3\xa8che was just as described . It was definitely sweet , but also salty . The spicy was also a pleasant surprise as it did n't overpower the sauce . I actually drizzled both on the waffle . The whipped cream topped fruit medley ( strawberries , blueberries , and blackberries ) was delish . I requested my fried eggs over medium hard and they knew exactly what that meant lol ! Everything was delicious and presented jus as pictured and described . I will definitely make it a point to order from them again , and even dine in next time . The sweet thank you note on each of the to-go boxes certainly left an impression , not to mention the great tasting food . TIP : Order early because they sell out of the waffle dish .

"So , we went to dinner there tonight . We got the appetizer special and 3 sushi rolls . At the end of the meal , the server actually asked us if we enjoyed the meal . I\ 've had it asked to me a thousand times before , and I usually reply the courtesy yes , it was fine '' but tonight , he was very sincere about wanting honest feedback about the meal . Specifically , he wanted feedback about the appetizer because I think they are experimenting with it . Now , I\ 've never exactly been subtle about my opinions but I think he was a little taken aback by my frank assessment of the restaurant ... I believe I referred to it as `` a little too Buckaroo Bonzai . '' Bistro 88 is a restaurant that doesn\'t know what it wants to be . It looks like it was decorated by an ambitious 11 year old whose mother came behind them and tried to make sense of the mess . For starters , the tables in the dining room area are set up as a very nice dining area . The tables are tastefully constructed and the chilled water bottles for each table are a good touch . While I think the room is a little dark , it holds its own as a desirable place to go eat . However , the rest of the ambiance leaves a bit to be desired . Let\ 's start with the outside . On the way in , the rusting metal lawn art ( think 6 foot roosters ) evokes more Cathedral of Junk than high end restaurant . They also seem to be growing veggies instead of plants . I can dig it , but it is awkward and discordant with the image I think they want to project . You open the door and see a monstrous neon sign better suited for an all you can eat buffet . They have both a bar and a sushi bar which I think takes up entirely too much room that could be better suited for tables ... especially since it makes the place look crowded , and I\ 've never seen more than a couple people at the bars ever ... or at least just have one bar . Then , bisecting the dining room are these large glass and water bubblers plus a giant fake jellyfish tank . The overall effect is bizarre ... the dining room isn\'t cohesive because of the bubblers and they make it look , well , cheap . The artwork is also rather strange.. I don\'t know how to explain it ... but its like if Andy Warhol and the Chairman Mao icon portrait had a baby . It\ 's a bit creepy to have these portraits staring at me while I eat . Of course , all of that has nothing to do with the food . We would go to the Bistro 88 more often if the food was more reliable . It\ 's probably the best sushi in the Westlake area , but that\ 's not exactly a compliment . When we left the husband remarked that all it did was make him hungry for good sushi . What did we like ? The appetizer was a seared tuna taco . Truthfully , it was the highlight of the meal . The tuna was good , the sauces were spicy and flavorful and the dish was mostly well composed . However , it was wrapped in a fried wonton wrapper that shattered when you bit into it . It would be better in smaller bite sized portions or maybe in a tostada shape using the wonton as a cracker . The sushi was a little like the 3 bears . One roll was bad , one was okay , and one was good . I\ 'm pretty adventurous in my sushi and I tend to gravitate to the unusual rolls . The unusual one was quite good . It was the tiger\ 's eye ( I think ) and it was a hot egg roll wrapped in a sushi roll . The overall effect was unique and flavorful . The vegetarian roll we got was okay , but nothing worth writing home about or recommending . The Rainbow roll was kinda appalling . It was a california roll with supposedly fresh raw fish across the top . We didn\'t finish it . What sort of ticked me off was when they asked about it , I said the shrimp tasted old and they agreed with me like they knew they were serving subpar shellfish . It wasn\'t the placate the customer platitudes , but more of the `` yeah , it could be fresher '' acknowledgment . The salmon was equally old tasting and off putting . On the other hand , the tuna and white fish did taste fresh and were well executed on the top of those pieces . When Bistro 88 is on , the food is excellent ... however , it needs to figure out what it wants to be ... it has a very schizophrenic overall appearance and I think the bottom line suffers .

His positive attitude set the mood for the cafe and touches all who walk in the door . He has a special way of making everyone feel not just welcome , but family .

"As someone with a gluten allergy , this is not a restaurant I\ 'd typically visit , as they are not known for being super gluten free friendly . But last night I attended an event there and decided to grab dinner beforehand . Although I was told by the host that there was no dedicated GF menu , he assured me that the regular menu had options . Well , although the bottom of the menu had GF= gluten free '' written out , not one item on the entire menu was labeled as being gluten-free . Seriously , nothing , not even the salad . Confused , I asked my waitress what my options were . She told me a few things and tried to be helpful . I also asked about the fries . Initially she told me they were GF , but then came back and said they were not as they were fried with other items . I asked if they could be baked and she said no . I then asked about another appetizer . After checking with the chef , she said that it was not GF as it `` contains blue cheese , which comes from bread . '' What ! ? ? ! She then said that the fries could be baked so I ordered those and an entree that I was also told was GF . Well , my meal was delicious and I thought everything seemed fine ...  . wrong . I ended up awake , sick as can be , for half of the night . I don\'t know what food item made me sick ( I also ordered the flourless chocolate cake for dessert which they told me was actually flourless ) but there was no mistaking the cause : gluten . For a restaurant in such a trendy place , you would think the staff would be more knowledgeable about food allergies . I grew up in the area and remember them having a decent GF menu several years back . Not sure what happened but I will not be returning . People with food allergies beware !","restaurant, restaurant--meal","Mixed, Positive",Restaurant

"I was reluctant to go here . My wife coaxed me into Genies and it was on a weekend day . Heres the secret for those of you who are not closing the bars the night before : Get there BEFORE the hung overs start dragging their feet to this joint like zombies in search of human flesh . We have since gone to Genies on weekdays and weekends with our kids and it is great . The food is always tasty . The coffee is strong and necessary . The cocktails are simply awesome - bloody mary in the morning , yes please ! You know what ? Thinking about service here makes me realize that we have consistently had great service . I have a deep amount of respect for staff that treat our kids well - they will always get good tips from me when that happens . I 'm looking at the previous votes here on Yelp and I see 4 votes for 'not good for kids ' . That makes me laugh because it might be some of the people I may offend with my hung over zombie reference above ...

"Came here yesterday for with coworkers to try the Restaurant Week lunch menu . I was excited to try Grotto b/c the RW lunch menu allowed you three courses for lunch instead of the regular two , and there were so many options for each course ! Grotto is located below ground level and is very small ( hence the name , I guess ) but it is also quite charming and comfortable . It would be a very cute place to go for a date . Because of its size , you would definitely need reservations , whether for lunch or dinner . Our waiter was very nice and took extra care to make sure the kitchen worked around a food allergy of one of my coworkers . Now to the food : I started with the calamari salad . The perfectly cooked calamari was mixed with greens dressed with a light vinaigrette . It was very good and a great start to my meal . For my entree , I chose the crab ravioli . The ravioli was also very tasty , although not spectacular . I found the ravioli a little too al dente for my taste ( ie undercooked ) but the sauce it was in was yummy . I finished off with the trio of ice cream , which was heavenly ! I also tried a friends brownie sundae which was also very delicious .

"One little change -- add an option of a marinara sauce without rosemary -- and this could be my new favorite pizza . The crust is fantastic , the prices are competitive , they cooked it up super fast and it was still hot when we got it home , and the ingredients were great , but unfortunately the only way I knew what the ingredients tasted like was when I pulled them off the pizza and ate them ( which was too bad because they were really good ) , otherwise all we tasted was the rosemary , it was really overwhelming . Got a Cyclops ( pepperoni , white onion and feta cheese ) and an order of Garlic Cheese Sticks ( yum , served on the pizza crust ) . And while they have some other choices for sauces , this was the only tomato based sauce and thats what I go for . Even my boyfriend , a rosemary lover , could n't finish his .

"This is by far one of my favorite casual dining spots . This location in particular ALWAYS has something going on so you will usually have to wait on average about 30 minutes . Wednesday night is Bike Night and they flood the parking lot with their cool bikes . I like looking at them so it doesnt bother me . The earlier you come the better because people tend to lounge around laughing and talking . Friday night has a DJ in the bar area and the music is LOUD . Typically , the bar area is real festive and the dining area is more family friendly . Again , expect to wait . My food has always been consistent but one time my guest had an issue and I do n't think it was handled well . The Manager was not apologetic or accommodating at all . A true accident , the server was cleaning the table next to us and dropped a container of ranch and it splashed all over my guest . The manager just wanted to provide a wet wipe only . Unacceptable . They ended up comping his meal but I did n't like that more was n't offered upfront since their server was at fault . Because I like the atmosphere , I kept my rating at a 4 but I do think they need to take better care of their patrons .

"We thought Il Localino had delicious food , though very expensive for what we got , and a bit deceptive in bringing items to the table that we didn\'t order and still charging us for it . The atmosphere was quirky : wall to wall pictures and posters ; colorful paper lanterns , disco balls , red/green rope lighting hanging in swirls from the ceiling ; smoke/mist blown out from a machine above us ; pop music turned up really loud periodically when the disco ball was revolving ... it was like something taken out of a Fellini movie . And the need for the huge bell ringing and birthday singing and weird hats given to customers ? That was distracting . Lastly , Ive never had a server crumb the table so many times , or waiters stuffing napkins down our shirts for the mussel dish , or the constant attention of the owner and wait staff . Only go here if you want to be entertained by odd and funky service and a comical atmosphere . And expect to pay the type of price you would find in a very classy Italian restaurant ... which this is not !

"Came with a a group of 18 . Food came out and no ones steak was cook right . Several were even still blue . But the worst part was that it took 45 minutes to work out the checks . The restaurant doesnt split the check for you . Each group had to go around and decode the check . Each meat and sauce and side was rung up separately , which made it even harder . And after the cards were swiped the totals did n't come out right and we all had to go back and figure out what the problem was . Everyone was totally frustrated why they could n't ring each group up separately on their end . Terrible service experience .

So sweet and yummy . Could use a double order ! - Gone Fishin ' - Whole deep fried fish , done south east asian style . The taste is genuine .

"I have to say up front that I am basing my review solely on the weekend brunch , I have not eaten dinner at Rosebud . The first time I had brunch here I found it to be really heavy/greasy and overpriced . I tried some sort of duck hash that was way too salty and tasted strange . The next time I had the salmon benedict which somehow managed to also be salty and greasy . My husband had the biscuit with friend chicken and gravy . He declared it ok . I wouldnt mind the price if the food lived up to it .

"Catch 122 is new -- and has great potential . I truly would like to see it succeed and would love to come back in 6 months and find that it has responded to consumer feedback and evolved into a great place . The owners , Brent and his wife , have clearly put a lot of love into the opening of this restaurant in a transitional neighbourhood on East Hastings . What a beautiful space -- open concept with exposed brick and beautiful wood tables and benches ( which Brent built himself ) and simple and elegent decor ( all picked out by his wife ) . The place is clean , airy , and inviting -- but visually appears a bit more like a lunch spot than a dinner spot . I enjoyed talking to Brent and hearing about the opening of the restaurant and all the work that went into it , their history running Indishpensable , and their success with lunch business . I dined here tonight because Brent invited a group of food writers out to help drum up some business through reviews and blog posts . Our entrees were complimentary , and many of us ordered appetizers , desserts , and drinks on our own . It\ 's a risky move -- to invite food writers to sample and review your restaurant . I can only hope that the investment in our meals generates some visits to this restaurant , but also that from our reviews some constructive feedback can be taken towards enhancing the place . I started off with a nice salad of beets , arugula , pickled fennel , and maple crusted goat cheese . It had a very light vinaigrette which I wasn\'t able to detect the citrus in , but was good . The salad was actually big enough to share and was quite nice . I would definitely order this again . I then ordered the coq au vin which felt like the most classic french item on the menu . It also was one of the few options that didn\'t come with pommes frites . The dish was substantially sized and in fact , I ended up taking leftovers home even after sharing the meal with my dining companions . There were two drumsticks and a thigh -- all the chicken had its skin intact . The chicken was okay , the sauce was good , and the potatoes and carrots were nice . I prefer my vegetables a touch undercooked so that they are crisp and retain the most nutrients . The carrots were prepared exactly this way -- great for my preference , but something to note in case you like mushy veggies . There were also mushrooms , pearl onions , and roasted garlic cloves in my dish . I would recommend this dish to a friend . Some of my dining companions did not fare as well with their entree selections . The catch of the day was halibut with a roasted pepper and orange cayenne coulis . This was served over potatoes and three asparagus . The unanimous consensus was that the halibut was seriously overcooked and dry , and there were too many potatoes and not enough asparagus . Another diner had the duck confit l\'orange which is something I typically love but thought was only okay . I was happy I had selected the coq au vin . I do wish , however , that there had been more options on the menu I would have liked . My second choice had been the pulled pork grilled cheese sandwich . I\ 'll try this next time . Lastly , I ordered the croissant bread pudding with apricot and creme Anglaise . I was hoping for something moist and rich , and it wasn\'t quite that in texture but was flavorful . I liked the frozen sugar-coated grapes and the blueberry sauce , but felt there were way too many berries on the plate . The menu hadn\'t mentioned fruit compote . I have to say -- service was friendly and attentive . Our server was Jade who I believe said she is the chef\ 's daughter . She was sweet and took excellent care of us . The rest of the staff were also friendly and helpful . I felt so awful for them that we were in fact the only diners during the 2 . 5 hours we were there on a Sunday night . I\ 'd love to see this place get more business . Per Brent , lunch is doing great and brunch is picking up also . Oh , and did you know they serve brunch till 5pm ? ? That\ 's sort of awesome , if you think about it . My advice to the owners : Walking by on E. Hastings , it\ 's easy to miss this spot . I didn\'t notice a menu in the window but I often stop to read menus . Simplify -- Takeout . Sandwiches . French fine dining . Cafe . Focus on what\ 's doing well and don\'t try to be too many things at once . Add some simple tablerunners to the tables for the evening service . Show off the beautiful wood , but also add that element of casual fine dining that\ 's a couple steps above a lunchtime sandwich shop . A few candles and punches of color throughout the space to make it more intimate will be nice , too . Maybe place a separator between the carryout refrigerators and the dining space . Not that you don\'t want to show off the fact that you offer great meals to go -- but somehow this feels a little too lunchtime '' in the dining space . Continue to work on the menu . Offer more side options besides pommes frites . Add more classically french dishes if that\ 's the direction you\ 're going .

"Just as prior reviewers , I too am a fan of the former AnTobar- pronounced OnTubber- ( which in Gaelic means The Well '' ) . My husband and I thought to give it a go before St .  Paddy\ 's so we stopped in on the night of the 15th . Very few patrons in the bar altogether so we sat at the bar . We had the pickle chips which were hot and crisp . I had the corned beef ( which could do without the sauce ) . The corned beef was good , but the dish ( which is 16 bucks , could do with a few more potatoes ( also good ) and cabbage for the bang . My husband got the club which he liked ( and he is hard to please ) . We finished the meal with the bread pudding , which we were told is made in house by a little old lady by the name of Ms .  Virginia ( not sure about that ) . The bread pudding was good and so was the sauce , it is a bit rich so get it on the side . Now for the tough critic review- I don\'t like that it has gone corporate . I don\'t like that there are nontraditional `` Irish '' food choices . Being an O\'Brien by maiden name I can be very harsh on those that like to pass themselves off as a traditional Irish pub . It seems to have lost some of the local feel .

Pretty much everything I asked for , I did not get .

"I confess I still don\'t understand why everyone pronounces Rogue '' as `` rouge '' in French since the spelling is obviously different . Yeah , there\ 's the red `` G '' in it , but the spelling is still wrong , people . Whatever you want to say about the Rogue brand , they have nice spaces . Their West Broadway location features generally bright spaces and a variety of seating styles and areas that look nicely maintained . 2 pints of beer ( $ 9 . 98 ) 2 virgin mojitos ( $ 7 . 98 ) Hand Tossed Artisan Pizza - Chewy super-thin crust Neapolitan style , but probably without the strict certification . About 15 or 16 inches in diameter , which is much better than the 11 or 12 inches you might get at a speciality Neapolitan pizza location like Famoso , and for roughly the same price . Comes with two oils at your table -- a weak chili and a strong olive oil with a large sprig of rosemary sitting inside -- and the standard issue chili flakes . Pizza - Quebec Whaaa ? ( $ 16 . 99 ) white sauce , sliced potatoes , braised beef short rib , cheese curds , garnished with gravy , parmesan , & fresh herbs- Looked like just one ring of large , thin , potato slices . - Pulled short rib was very unevenly distributed . The gravy looked like it mostly settled around the middle . The result was , depending on which slice you got , you may have had a very different experience . - Overall , sounded fun but turned out boring and not very tasty . Pizza - Funghi ( $ 16 . 99 ) roasted mushrooms , IPA braised onions , goat cheese & roasted garlic on white sauce- Rather salty . Otherwise okay . Turned out our pizzas were moderately burnt : - About 1/4 of the potato slices ( the portion curled up off the pizza ) was burnt black . - The mushrooms were burnt black . they started out brown , but everything facing upward was burnt and thinner slices were crispy black . - On the Quebec Whaaa ? , the underside had large areas of burnt-to-crispy-black that was bitter enough to dominate the taste , so we tore those off . The Funghi pizza was okay . The busser who brought it obviously didn\'t mention anything ( surely they wouldn\'t have served it if they could spot that it was over-baked ) so we were willing to chalk it up to `` it\ 's supposed to be that way '' especially since Neapolitan pizzas are basically flash-baked . But when our server came by and we asked , she confirmed they were burnt and `` not supposed to be like that '' . She said she\ 'd get the manager to come sort it out but no one ever appeared ( they may I suppose have gone home since it would have been midnight or after by that time ) . Anyway , we had been willing to let it go and by then we\ 'd eaten about half of the pizzas , so we didn\'t make a fuss . But that experience brought up the question of how much to trust the kitchen and server . I have always been under the impression that the kitchen should definitely know if they\ 've screwed something up . And the server is the second chance at quality assurance before your food hits the table . So when my order arrives , I generally trust that if anything looks off , it\ 's probably meant to be that way and I chalk it up to creative license -- otherwise , chefs wouldn\'t have any creativity at all if ( for example ) every instance of a particular sauce must taste exactly the same everywhere . So our burnt-pizza experience really made me question just when to question the server and possibly send something back . And it was also disappointing that the servers didn\'t quality control our pizzas , especially when the busser who brought it to our table said the only pizza he hadn\'t yet tried was the Quebec Whaaa ? On the other hand , incidents like this also emphasize just how important it is for the server to check on diners shortly after their meals have arrived to make sure everything is okay . Service was otherwise okay . Curious thing to spot about Rogue : The drinks menu says something about your beer glass having something special on the bottom to release bubbles ( ? ) . Didn\'t spot it on our beer glass , but there was a water-level line on the glass labelled `` re-order '' .","Rogue, Rogue--Quebec--underside, Rogue--Hand Tossed Artisan Pizza, Rogue--pizzas, Rogue--pizzas--mushrooms, Rogue--spaces, Rogue--Funghi, Rogue--Hand Tossed Artisan Pizza--crust, Rogue--servers, Rogue--pizzas--thinner slices, server, Rogue--Quebec, Rogue--pizzas--potato slices","Mixed, Negative, Positive, Negative, Negative, Positive, Negative, Positive, Negative, Negative, Negative, Negative, Negative",Restaurant

Add the popping rocks and its pretty cool . Nice and light . The fruits are sweet and not sour . Guess they know how to pick the good fruits for the desert . Ferrero Rocher drink . Was not overly sweet . They were very generous on the ferrero rocher chocolate . Definitely you can taste that it was not water down and added syrup . This is the best Ferrero rocher drink I had so far . Overall , I am impressed . I was told that the desert chef trained and was an apprentice of the desert chef at Honeymoon Dessert \xe6\xbb\xa1\xe8\xae\xb0\xe7\x94\x9c\xe5\x93\x81 .

"If I could give 2 . 5 stars I would , but I just didnt want to give a full 3 implying it 's somehow better than average . Fin 's ( in Boston ) is the definition of average . I have n't had anything besides sushi and fried rice there but the fried rice was very oily and somewhat on the clumpy side so I was n't impressed . Ordering the sushi was a big mistake . I mean seriously I do n't know how I made that mistake when Avana Sushi , Genki Ya and countless other better sushi places live a block away in either direction . I 'll chalk it up to late night delirium . Anyway , the sushi was below average ( especially given the neighborhood ) so go elsewhere for your fix . This was disappointing because I used to live by the Fin 's in Brookline ( granted it was 5 years ago ) and remember being impressed by the food so either quality has dropped or my tastes have improved .

"We went here on a Saturday night at 7 and fortunately got right in . As visitors to Portland , we had no idea where to go and turned to Yelpers for recommendations . Well done , Yelpers . We loved almost everything : the beet and basil salad , the pork loin , the steamed clams , the lamp chop , the bread , the Cuban black beans , the salmon , and the devils food cake ( they were out of the mousse , unfortunately ) . Not quite as crazy about the Linzer torte , and the only real miss of the night was the chicken dish .

You can get really great quality tea from myriad cafes around town for much less . The menu is generally more expensive than the places I normally visit downtown , and that may be because of the neighborhood in which the cafe is located , but it really is cost prohibitive for those of us on a budget .

This place is all about taking simple recipes and preparing them expertly with additional touches that push them over the edge . Nice , artsy ambience though a bit loud . Drinks were good . Newtown Centre was nice and boozy like a Manhattan . The Caipirinha was good too ... strong and citrusy ! To start we had the fries , which were fine , but nothing to write home about . Second , we had the broccoli and kale , which was recommended very strongly by our waitress . It was tasty with a perfect char and lemon finish , but not as mind blowing as we expected for $ 10 . I wonder if they 'd ever try cauliflower instead ? Lobster fritters were perfectly fried , but overpriced for 4 small ones . The Ni\xc3\xb1os Envueltos were incredible though .

We get spicy ketchup with what I believe is chipotle and the fries are topped with a seasoning that contains some salt , maybe parsley ? Either way , they were good and I scarfed them .

"The good old 88 Tofu house . Try as I might , I can not get my Korean best friend ( the one who takes me to places like 88 Tofu House ) to explain the 88 part to me . I guess its just not meant to be that I understand . Regardless , you cant hardly miss the place if you 're looking for it . Get off 285 , get on Buford Highway , look for big 88 sign , and bam , you 've found it . I guess it at least scores points for not being confused with other 24 hour tofu houses on Buford highway ? By far my favorite thing to order is the spicy tofu soup , though maybe I 'm now weaksauce , or maybe its because I show up with a Korean person , but when I get the spicy I am not disappointed . Our table always sounds like a symphony of colds , because we just sit there eating this delicious soup and having our noses running and tearing up a bit from all the pepper they put into things . I really enjoy it , though I can imagine the quality can vary , I mean look at the place . A true pleasure is watching the Korean TV , which constantly runs in the background , and always makes me wonder if they could just turn the TV off , and the image from the show would just be burned into the screen and they would n't need to use the electricity any more . Also excellent are the appetizers , which for being such a cheap restaurant are actually pretty good , and you get a nice selection . A nice touch is that in the winter when you come they will give you this hot barley water , which tastes really good on a cold night , and actually works really well to clear my sinuses for some reason . The downside to that being that if you order spicy food , do you really want a hot drink ? I generally have to ask for some ice water to go along with it , so that I can have the best of both worlds . Other than the tofu soups , I think the food is pretty middling . The bulgogie is n't bad but is pretty bland and kind of stringy , and the rice bowls I 've gotten were good , but not really anything spectacular . But really , at 2 AM , you do n't want something spectacular , you just want tofu in a bowl with some beef and a raw egg that cooks in there .

It had a bit of heat but it would be considered mild to those used to the spice level in Thailand/South East Asia .

"This was a pleasant surprise and unexpectedly yummy adventure . There was some doubts to the quality of flavor , as my Philly roll was falling apart a little bit , and the donut roll we ordered became a little impractical because that too was slightly falling apart .

"Happy hour here is truly a great deal . Theyve got some really fun choices and they do n't do the half price/half the size switcheroo during this time like some other restaurants do . You get good portions just the same . I like to get their poke sashimi bowl and it has plenty of ahi and seaweed salad , cucumbers . I also adore the monkey brain they have on happy hour . They give you a whole avocado cut in half , add some chunks of spicy tuna , add some roe and off you go . Delicious . I have to have my uni even if it is not on the HH menu . The price is only 5 . 00 and it truly was very fresh and sweet . They are not busy either on a friday so lots of room at their restaurant .

"We made the trek down here from having drinks on 23rd . Big ups to Muu-Muus for being open late on a Tuesday . It wasn\'t very busy , so we seated ourselves , as directed by the sign . About ten minutes passed before the server arrived . I was starting to think about leaving when she showed up . She was pleasant enough , but was clearly more than a little stressed out . At one point she forget my dining companion Lauren\ 's drink order and yelled Whiskey Coke ? '' across the restaurant . We were in the first booth by the bar , so it wasn\'t that far away , but she interrupted our conversation and it felt weird having the server yell at us . Lauren was very perturbed that they swapped out the large `` Heath Ledger '' painting on the south wall for an abstract artistic rendering of a threesome . The atmosphere is pretty standard for Portland . Dark cozy booths , a large bar , red tapestries draped around the wall art ... It\ 's a cross between a gothic 50s lunch counter and an art house theater lobby . She insisted that I try the Muu-Muu burger ( $ 7 . 50 ) ; a `` sirloin burger , '' American cheese and fries , all smushed together on a French Roll . We also ordered a plate of the miniature mushrooms ( $ 5 ) off the happy hour menu . The shrooms were gorgeous and delicious ! They arrived in a generous pile . I was hooked after the first bite . It made me temporarily forget that I was just eating mushrooms . Each shroom was cooked perfectly , which is hard to do with mushrooms . They were tender without being soggy or soft . I forget which type of mushroom they were , since the menu just said `` miniature mushroms . '' Which is not something I typically eat by themselves . But these were that good . They were bathed in a pool of light garlic-butter-lemon sauce that infused each one with salty/buttery goodness . Then the Muu-Muu burger arrived . It came in a small baguette and wrapped in wax paper and stuffed with a fistful of fries . One thing I did notice about this sammy was that patty was really small for a `` burger . '' And it didn\'t help that it came on a very large and bready baguette , which made the patty seem even smaller . I felt like I was eating mostly bread . The burger was well-executed for what it was . It was cooked all the way through all half centimeter of it and it had some extra spices in there that gave it a nice Italian sausage-esque flavor . The baguette was fresh and chewy . The server dropped off a bottle of ketcup , which I really appreciated since I usually have to ask for it . I\ 'd definitely come back and try some other happy hour menu offerings and probably will return since it\ 's one of the only places to a decent late night drunchie fix . They also have patio furniture for people watching on 21st .

Ive been several times and my usual order is the peel-and-eat shrimp , a dozen raw oysters ( with tons of tasty horseradish and sauce ) and the fish dip ! I ca n't get enough of that trio and everything is modestly priced , especially for a Winter Park treat ! You can never go wrong with their beer flight or the spicy margarita ; both are delicious and the service is so great and knowledgeable they know exactly what to suggest for beer options !

"Ok so our waiter was amazing . Told him I was vegan and he ran back to the kitchen several times to double check everything . I had the veggi lo mein which is not vegan . Swap the egg noodle for rice noodle and the oyster sauce for soy and BAM . My husband split this was me , thank god . Hes not vegan but kind of enough to entertain my lifestyle . It was $ 18 and a TON of food . Surprisingly fresh tasting . Flavors were good but a little lacking in the well rounded or exciting department of things , a little one note but hey , its Disney . ( no I do not have the highest opinion of their food )  . Also had a small house salad with ginger dressing . For $ 3 you can add this to any entree . Pretty good deal and just enough freshness to cut the salty carb heavy noodle dish .","veggi lo mein, noodle, waiter, veggi lo mein--Flavors","Positive, Positive, Positive, Positive",Restaurant

"We enjoyed a friends birthday celebration there , first & foremost the singer was great & provided some fab spanish dance music . However since we were a large party they tacked on 20 % gratuity which explains why we only had one server for more than 17 people ; since he was getting a guaranteed tip he really was not able to serve the entire table . They were expecting this group so don\'t understand why we had to wait & really never receive extra bread with our tapas or meals ? Luis , our waiter kept saying about the bread , I am trying ''  . Never received water refills either , must have had to beg for it . We did order Garlic Shrimp tapa ( it was good & flavorful ) and Chicken Chorizo Paella ( not bad ) . However , we left with a bill for 2 for $ 86 and hubby never ordered a drink .","spanish dance music, Garlic Shrimp tapa, waiter, Chicken Chorizo Paella, bill, singer","Positive, Positive, Negative, Positive, Negative, Positive",Restaurant
"Making our way through the Cols Coffee trail and stopped for our second cup of coffee of the morn . Walked in and was immediately greeted by the owner . At first I was overwhelmed with him starting up talking about his history of how he stated making coffee , but it quickly became apparent he was passionate about coffee and I thoroughly enjoyed hearing about it . He graciously let us try each type of coffee and even threw in a delicious homemade German pastry ( which was amazing ) .

"I just came back from Chicha and I enjoyed the food , but to be honest I think I prefer Silvestre in Gastown . Having lived in Peru , I became accustomed to certain types of food etc and I always love that when I go to Silvestre , I order in Spanish and always have pleasant conversation with the lady who runs it . There is something to be said about the feeling of authenticity . We had the antichuchos pollo , ceviche , papa rellena , causa atune and arroz chaufa . The anticucho wasn\'t very good , the chicken was dry but the sauces were nice - that being said ... chicken antichuco isn\'t really typical and I\ 'm sure the corazon would have been much nicer . I had a moment when the server brought it us and pronounced pollo as polo '' ( as in the type of shirt ) . Papa rellena , causa and arroz chaufa were really good but the ceviche was lacking . I\ 've had some really good ceviche during my time in South America and this unfortunately did not compare . Not to mention that ceviche in Peru is typically served with A LOT of red onion . It really adds to the flavour but I do get that different countries in South America approach ceviche differently . That\ 's just how I always had ceviche in Peru . All in all , the food was very good . Serving sizes a bit small for my taste but I get that I can\'t compare what I used to get in Peru versus what I get in Canada . Different country , different standards . Still ...

Fall is really the best time when the tourist groups tend to whine down . I have come to believe that it does n't matter where you eat on Hanover Street , all the restaurants are fantastic ... I swear by it ! I 've even gone to the world-famous Giacomo 's , but prefer other locales , like Cafe Pompeii , because of the less rushed feel .

I love reading their enewsletter to find out what is going to be on the menu for the weekend . Its also a great place to snag a weekend reservation when all the other restaurants are booked ! This time we sat at the 6 top by the kitchen and in my opinion we had the best seats in the house because we could see them prepping food and we got served first . The other people we sat with were also foodies and we had a great discussion on the best restaurants in Portland . Our service was smooth and the portions were appropriately sized . My only complaint was that the large bits of salt on our salad course did n't get mixed in enough .

For pete 's sake , I 've chosen Uchiko 3 times for my birthday dinner in the last 6 years . If anything , recent experiences are more consistent in service and execution than years back . Time has not lowered their standards at all . In case you are n't already on board with these hints : Do the omakase ( tasting menu ) . If you pretend you know best and try to pick out what you 've liked before or what sounds good , you will miss some amazing dishes - that you 'd probably never pick yourself . The chefs know what 's best . Trust them . For example , I always love their oysters , and they were sadly not on the menu on a recent visit . But omakase ... and the first plate is beautiful oysters in a spicy savory broth . If it 's on the menu , you want to include the wagyu nigiri . Trust me . You do .

This was a dish not to miss . Brussel sprouts were well done soft and succulent with a buttery rich flavor that shone through . It was highlighted by a bit of pork garnish but ot overpowered by it . The risotto with chorizo was creamy yet the rice had enough tooth to it . The grains were plump but not bursting or mushy . The chorizo was complex and smokey without too much oiliness . The olive platter was excellent with a good mix of high quality olives and almonds . There were several specials that we tried . Overall no dish was a miss at all .

"CLARIFICATION : This place has no relation to that other hot pot place in Richmond . If you pay attention to your animals , the one in Richmond is called Little Sheep Hot Pot . It\ 's even more confusing in Chinese , because that one is called Little Fat Lamb '' while this one is `` Little Fat Cow . `` Well , it\ 's been over a year since I was in the mood for Chinese hot pot , which gave rise to my first visit . Meanwhile , believe it or not , I have been here for NON hot pot food , which is reasonably priced and cleanly presented , but somewhat lacking in what the Cantonese call `` wok hei '' ( that stir-fried flavor depth that I can best approximate in Burger King parlance as flame-broiled flavor )  . The other night , however , perhaps dampened by the weather , I returned for my second all-you-can-eat endeavor . We phoned ahead to make a reservation ( strongly advised ) and had a booth waiting for us . It may have been that our table looked different from the others that we received particularly attentive service -- for , instead of a group of boisterous , ravenous , and youthful Asians that is typical for this place , it was my parents , grandma , and myself . In fact , we got into quite a lengthy conversation with the owner , who also operates Jumbo Seafood down the street . Speaking of seafood , this is why my second visit eradicated one Yelp star from my prior fandom : While I quite enjoyed the variety of delicious Cow cuts , the Seafood selections were not fresh . And seafood is , after all , half of the name . The oysters were a bit off ( it wasn\'t the season , we were told ) and the various fish-product balls were all a tad too fishy . My favorite items to re-order were slices of beef ribeye and sirloin , as well as the pork jowl/cheek . I also wish they would be more generous with their selection of sauces , rather than raking in extra charges .

The place is pretty tight , so seating for parties of 5+ is limited to the very back two tables . We had to wait a while , but it wasn\'t that bad . The staff was extremely helpful in shortening our wait . I had some kinda potato scramble '' that didn\'t have eggs in it . Cheesy , fluffy , pretty good ! But on the menu , there was some tempting rhetoric about it being `` spicy '' , but there was only a sparse sprinkling of paprika , resulting in only the most inconsequential Scoville spike . 300 or 400 maybe ? The dollop of sour cream was way too generous . My plate looked like the payoff scene of a bukkake flick . ( Sorry ! ) I think I will try something with sausage and eggs next time , \'cos it seemed like everyone else\ 's breakfast looked way better than mine .","place--sausage, place--breakfast, place--eggs, place--sour cream, place, place--staff, place--Cheesy, place--diets","Positive, Positive, Positive, Positive, Mixed, Positive, Positive, Positive",Restaurant
"I love Muu Muus ! I remember going there when it was called Casa You Betcha..

The menu is interesting and varied and really well done in my opinion . Usually when I 'm there it is for drinks and to order a few things to share around the table..the Thai Coconut soup is awesome..as are the steak bites ... tortilla soup ... satay skewers ... great happy hour menu . While I have n't eaten many full on dinners ..I snag bites from friends ..and MuuMuu 's really puts out some good food..always a chalkboard special which have been great the couple of times I 've had them .

"After looking at the websites and comparing reviews on Aster\ 's and Karibu , a friend and I ended up here for the lunch buffet . We were expecting a few vegetarian things ( lentils galore , etc . ) , but they surprised us with a good sampling of around a dozen dishes , including a well-seasoned ( and somehow still moist ) doro wat . There were also four or five beef dishes , including one with authentic Ethiopian spices '' and an adjacent dish with `` even more authentic Ethiopian spices , '' plus the expected array of lentils , beans , and cabbage . Speaking of spices , everything I ate was full-flavored , including some that had a fair amount of heat . I\ 'm always surprised when buffets offer dishes that burn ( though let\ 's not kid ourselves , this isn\'t Thai spicy or anything ) , and it was nice to walk out with a little bit of a tingling on my tongue . There were also a couple salads , one of greens and tomatoes with a very acidic vinaigrette ( a trend I\ 've seen among Ethiopian restaurants ) and another with lentils that was very refreshing . The injera was fluffy , on the thicker side ( from my experience ) , and available at the buffet . It had a great tang , and I appreciated not having to ask for it every time . Next to the flatbread was dessert , which consisted of slices of chocolate and lemon cakes -- nothing special , but generous nonetheless . Service was great . Summer time in Austin means I drink water like a fish , and they were quick to refill my glass . Not much else to service on a buffet , but I\ 've found many places can\'t really manage that . Decor is clean and understated ( though there are some amusing pieces of art and advertising from Ethiopia ) . Over all , definitely a great deal for lunch , and not hugely packed on a weekday .","Decor, injera, everything, dessert, doro wat, dishes, lunch, tang, lentils","Positive, Positive, Positive, Positive, Positive, Positive, Positive, Positive, Positive",Restaurant

"I was in Austin on business and picked up a flier about this restaurant from the Marriott desk . I ordered the 8 oz ribeye , medium rare , which was said to come with salad , potato , roll . Prompt delivery but no salad , no butter for the roll , no butter for the potato . Delivery person offered to go to his car where he thought he had some extra butter . While he was gone , I decided to start on the steak . Too tough to cut with plastic knife and fork , there was a slab of fat and gristle covering the top . When the delivery man came back to the hotel room with the butter , I showed him that it was tough , and I could BARELY rip it apart with my hands . I asked for my money back but let him keep the $ 5 tip . I can not imagine any cook serving a steak that was so obviously covered with a thick slab of fat and gristle . Horrifying . They absolutely deserve these awful reviews . I wish I hadnt been so hungry that I ordered without looking on Yelp first .","restaurant, restaurant--delivery, restaurant--steak, They","Mixed, Mixed, Negative, Negative",Restaurant

The service was really great and friendly and the bartender made suggestions of different drinks to try when we asked .

"To avoid long weekend waits , I would suggest coming here on weekday evenings . A girlfriend and I came here on a Thursday night , and didn\'t have to wait at all for a table , despite a bustling First Thursday '' night . I had the chipotle shrimp quesadilla and chips/salsa as an appetizer , and my friend got the goat cheese salad . I didn\'t share the level of excitement expressed by other reviewers for the chips and salsa appetizer - most authentic Mexican restaurants make it much better and much cheaper . The guac was ok . The queso flameado was gross . The cheese was not even malleable enough for us to dip a chip into , so it just sat in front of us , hardened and untouched the entire night . The shrimp quesadilla , however , was exquisitely flavorful , and I would have eaten more had I not been gabbing away with my friend the whole night ! The interior is much finer that you would expect from the outside - as the hostess led us to our table , I suddenly felt underdressed in my tank top and jeans while weaving through well dressed patrons in pantsuits and dresses . I forgot about this as soon as I sat down , though , because our waitress treated us as if we were decked out in black tie . Our waitress was impressive - attentive , professional , respectful , and prompt . I was a bit weirded out that she was shadowed by another waitress , and couldn\'t quite tell if said waitress was the trainer or trainee , or just bored . It gets really loud in here . As it is , I have a quiet , deep voice , so it took quite a bit of energy to project over the din , taking away from the experience somewhat . Another criticism is that we felt rushed to pay and leave as we started winding down with our meal . Were it not for this minor irritation , I would have given SCC five starts . Not that this is any different from most restaurants in America , though . The thing I love about dining in Europe is that the waitstaff do not bother you after they serve your food ; they let you stay for hours drinking wine and chatting . Although our waitress was considerate and refrained from giving us our check until we asked , the clearing of the plates and repeated interruptions had the same impact as a bill not-so-subtly handed to us . I\ 'm confused about why so many reviewers describe this restaurant as `` pricey . '' My friend and I paid $ 20 each for a dinner we couldn\'t even finish - two mains , an appetizer , and drinks . I would say this is average for any restaurant in Austin , and even cheaper than comparably nice restaurants like South Congress Caf . It was lovely to be able to walk our dinner off on a perfect summer night through the lively scene on S. Congress . I recommend coming here on the first Thursday of the month at some point this summer , and then checking out all the stores and vendors after your meal . It makes for a great Austin night . I will definitely be coming back here !","S. Congress, S. Congress--scene, S. Congress--cheese, S. Congress--interior, S. Congress--waitress, S. Congress--shrimp quesadilla, S.

"Pretty pricey for some wings , was expecting at least jumbo or regular size wings . Instead I got super small flats and drumsticks . For my order of 16 wings I got two different sauces , seems like they just fried them and poured the sauce on after with most of the wings uncovered , I had to sauce them myself . Overall with the price and portion size I would probably not come here again . Ill do an updated review if I do , and if their portions are still the same size I 'll just give them a thumbs down .

Marlows Tavern is a nice place to eat . Cute little shopping center right off the highway lots of options to eat around it decent parking . The side parking is free which is another nice option . I had a chicken entree I enjoyed it very much . Wife had a fish entree which was just okay . The drink an alcoholic beverage that my wife chose according to her was okay I think it was a sangria . I would come back to this place and eat here again overall everything was good .,"Marlows Tavern--chicken entree, Marlows Tavern","Positive, Positive",Restaurant
"I am seriously starting to question the validity of yelp reviews in Boston . I do my research before spending my hard earned dough at a restaurant , but they seem grossly skewed . Maybe it\ 's because I cook all the time and can make most dishes you find in a restaurant myself , or maybe I am just a deuche . Either way , Metropolis Cafe is pretty mediocre . Let me start : Butternut Squash , bland and look like it came from a can , \\ based on the texture . The highlight was the crispy Pancetta sprinkled on top , which was sparse . Seared Scallops : with cous-cous ? You serious about that ? Enveloped in some tomato-y-sauce , which totally killed the natural flavors of the scallops , which were grossly over seasoned . For desert , which came with my girlfriend meal deal '' since it\ 's restaurant week in the South End , 3 hard pieces of pears , with some Marscipone cheese , and ummmm sprinkled cinnamon ? It\ 's like the chef just said to hell with it , and through a bunch of ingredients into the air like a bizarre form of dessert roulette . I forgot to mention my 9 $ glass of 3 oz of wine in some glass that could have been bought at the dollar store . I guess if you order a bottle you get the `` good '' glasses , because I saw people drinking from proper wine glasses but they had bottles . It\'\ 's like your Mom saving the good china for a special occasion . Maybe I am snob , but if I am going to pay 24 $ for a entree at least use decent stemware . Perhaps I expect too much from restaurant row in the South End , but so far my best experience has been at Bukowski\ 's ( no where near the South End ) where I spent 50 $ on 4 beers and amazing pub food .","Metropolis Cafe, Metropolis Cafe--Butternut Squash--crispy Pancetta, scallops, Metropolis Cafe--Butternut Squash, Metropolis Cafe--wine, scallops--flavors, Metropolis Cafe--dessert roulette, Bukowski\ 's--pub food, Bukowski\ 's, Metropolis Cafe--Butternut Squash--texture","Mixed, Positive, Negative, Mixed, Negative, Negative, Negative, Positive, Positive, Negative",Restaurant

"I have come to conquer territories ! Oh , ok I\ 've come to eat some empanadas , corn cakes , and wonderous fried plaintain chips . Everything was crispy and not oily . There was plenty to eat . The different stuffings inside the empanadas were all vegetarian . There was beans/cheese , mushrooms , brie/hazelnut , etc . The plaintains were cut thick enough that they looked like banana pieces . Really delicious . There were dipping sauces and we enjoyed the tomatillo sauce and the guacamole . The corn cakes were light and also stuffed with all kinds of vegetarian goodies . It was basically a buffet at our table . They have side salads that go along with the entrees . Lots of unusual items on their menu which had a definite authentic vibe to it . We met the cook and I had read that she was from Venezuela , and was focusing on that type of food here . The bartender was pretty busy and she was the only one taking the orders but she did quite well . They\ 've got some fun cocktails . I had the Fancy Lady '' which was a bubbly drink . The inside is decorated with lots of light fixtures from the 60s/70s.. you know the amber lights that are pocked and have the black metal around them . They also have a badly done Conquistador looking painting which goes with the lighting . Comfy cushiony chairs to sit at at the tables . They\ 've got an outdoor section but , ( my pet peeve ) , the tables have ashtrays on them so the folks that don\'t pollute have to sit inside when it\ 's beautiful out .

We chose the ones from back in the 60s/70s , including Tighten up ( both sides of the record ) , James Brown , T Rex , Yardbirds etc . You could hear the needle picking up after each song . And yes , they do have the song Conquistador , but it was not by Procol Harum and we did not want that dirge in our minds forever so we did not play it . Someone else did though .

"I went to Cafe Josies with my enamorado in celebration of my 25th birthday . Feeling the full weight of my quarter century , I decided I wanted to eat early , arriving just as happy hour was ending . The manager ( or bar tender ? host ? ) seated us and told us we could have our first drink for half price . For our first drink , we ordered an entire bottle of Pinot Grigio . Pleasantly lubricated , we made the bold choice to stick to seafood and vegetarian appetizers ( Austin 's steady stream of barbecue has made me feel like I consistently have enough protein in my bloodstream to last a moderate nuclear winter ) . We deviated from that course of action only slightly , ordering the rabbit salad with hummus and fried chick peas , a special that night . The green beans that came along with the rabbit salad were the green beans of my dreams , lightly steamed , tender , bright green and unafraid , proud even , of their bold , naked beany-ness . I loved having the hummus along with the fried chickpeas . There is something delightfully naughty and barbaric about having two kinds of the same thing on your plate . For me , the best of the starters was the crispy oyster salad . In the past , I have n't liked fried oysters , as breading dulls the powerful impression that you are , in fact , Poseidon , consuming their briny , sloppy entrails in a single , masterful bite . The crispy exterior of these oysters was light enough that the fishy flavor still reigned supreme . Peaches with ice cream for dessert was the first thing in my 25th year that made me really glad I made it this long . We originally ordered it as a pretense for remaining seated a little while longer - I had a very real fear that if we got up so soon after finishing the Pi Gris , I would trip and accidentally suffocate the well-behaved infant seated nearby . So we ordered the peaches . The waitress was very nice , in spite of our obvious ruse . Peaches are in their peak season . Ice cream is also in its peak season . Together , they came in a pink sauce of simple syrup , peach juice , and kaffir lime . A crunchy ginger cookie lay shattered dramatically across the plate . I was pretty drunk and told the waitress to pay my compliments to the chef , which I have never done before and I pray God I never will again .

Its still somewhat authentic but seems to be much greasier than before . Sigh . This place is still jam packed with many repeat customers which shows some customer loyalty still exists . Okay , I took my girlfriend here coz I 've been raving about it to her forever and she 's never been here . ( The last last time I came here was over 2 years ago )  . We ordered Scallion Pancake , Singaporean Rice Noodles , and Taiwanese Pork Cutlet Rice . It is not what it used to be ! I 'm even wondering if they changed a chef ! The scallion pancake was all fried and crispy unlike your usual Taiwanese scallion pancakes I was used to eating there . The Singaporean rice noodles were greasy beyond repair ( even though we asked the waitress to use less oil ) . It tasted like greasy soy sauce and we did n't finish it because it was too difficult to swallow even with all the grease they used while cooking ! The pork cutlet rice was nothing like authentic Taiwanese-style pork cutlet rice , and believe me , I 've lived in Taiwan for a few years ! The fried skin of the cutlet fell right off upon serving . There was about 1/8 cup of greasy spinach and a very fatty portion of pork cutlet with lots of fried skin on the side ... There was a lot of very dry white rice to go with everything ... The waitress ' attitude was also very poor when we ordered and paid the bill . She seemed very anxious , impatient , and rude , even though there were only 3 tables being served at the time because we came exactly at their evening opening time to beat the usual waiting line .

We descended the stairs and walked in , and I was hit by a wall of amazing , delectable scents wafting through the air . If Grotto were in my neighborhood , I would be here each and every night . No , I am not exaggerating . We were seated and opened the menu , and they had Montepulciano by the glass ... I was completely smitten . They have an absolutely amazing prix-fixe menu , so we each decided upon our dinners and sat back to enjoy the ambiance . The Montepulciano was divine and mellow , and went beautifully with the meal . The first course arrived : fontina cheese fondue accompanied by beef tenderloin , aged balsamic , truffle oil , and portobello mushrooms . I dove into absolute cheese bliss and had to convince myself not to lick the fondue bowl at the end . The second course was chicken parmesan with fresh mozzarella , tomatoes and cheese manicotti . It was quite delicious , but not knock-your-socks-off like the fondue . I ended up taking half of it back to our hotel and we enjoyed it for breakfast the next morning . Dessert was banana bread pudding with caramel ice cream and walnuts .

"Last night a small group and I were searching for something sweet after dinner , but could not endure the acoustic guitar playing what seemed to be the soundtrack to Shrek in front of Salt & Straw . We all like pie , so we decided to check out Random Order Pie Bar . Pies , booze , evening coffee , what a great idea ! No crazy line ? Even better . We ordered a slice of banana cream , bourbon pecan , and strawberry rhubarb . None of us were all that impressed with our pies , but I was thoroughly unimpressed with my slice of bourbon pecan . When it was placed on the counter , the consistency of the pie\ 's filling was SO DRY that part of it crumbled off . Folks , I\ 'm no expert on pecan pie , but I\ 'm pretty sure it\ 's not supposed to do that . The pecan pie I have become accustomed to has a gooey texture in the middle , keeping the nutty bits intact . This slice of pecan was crumbling apart , leaving the pecan mince all over the plate . The filling had the consistency of wet sand and tasted mostly like molasses . Not like bourbon , nor pecan . No , no . This was not your average pecan pie , it was so much worse . I will spare you the review of the crust for now because it was also not ideal . My boyfriend got the banana cream pie and that was actually somewhat decent . The cream was rich and delicious , though I wish there was a little bit more banana filling . The banana filling was custardy and had the perfect amount of sweetness . However , again , the crust was not very good . I only had a quick bite of the filling of the strawberry rhubarb . It was fine , but on the sweeter side as though it was mostly strawberry . The crusts all around were horrible . The bottom of my pecan pie tasted like paper . Not buttery in the slightest . I don\'t write a lot of reviews because most of the time , the Yelp ! page is pretty on par with my experience at a place . However , this Yelp ! page seems to have a lot of poorly directed pie fanatics and people who don\'t seem to get '' that restaurants where you order from a counter and restaurants where you order from a waiter require a different level of service expectation . Like , someone wrote a pie-centric parody of `` Hello Goodbye '' in a review . Seriously ?

I love their baked beans - they 're rich and flavourful , and the closest to English baked beans that I 've had here ! Score !

I like that they have both breakfast and lunch items on the menu - I ALWAYS want breakfast , but considering they serve brunch until 4pm it 's a good idea to have lunchy things for those that want them !

When the food came out it was lukewarm bordering cold ...  . We were starving so it didn\'t really matter at that point . I personally felt the lasagna had ZERO flavor . Like nothing . This was surprising as a lot of people seem to like this . It just tasted bland is the best way to describe it . The pizza was good and the crust had good flavor . During dinner I kept my thoughts about the lasagna to myself . Fast forward to the next day and my hubby said that lasagna had no flavor . '' LOL . So this was not just my taste buds ... Validation !

Always for breakfast . Always order the \'traditional breakfastWas told by the young lady ( not owner ) med boiled eggs not allowed ( only poached ? ? ) . Then the young lady explained to me that poached were `` just like boiled , but without the shell '' . That was very helpful . At the moment there were 2 or 3 other tables , the cook had no other orders . I advised the young lady if they could not accommodate , White Spot would ( just down the street ) . I was told , bye bye . So , a mom and pop businesses turned away a customer over 2 eggs . Why would a business feel that strongly over 2 boiled eggs ?

"Im confused . Most of the reviews for this place seemed pretty awesome , but what was missing during brunch ? The service was awful to begin with and got progressively better throughout the meal . I will say the only reason they get 2 stars is because of the service . The food would get 0 stars if that were an option . The hash browns were murdered . They were cut up like Dexter 's victims and then sadly murdered again in the deep fryer . They were the worst hash browns I 've had in as long as I can remember . When you stab a hash brown , you hear a crunch . When you bite into it ... it 's empty and there 's nothing inside . Whomever is deep frying needs to step away from the machine . The best part of the meal was the coffee . How sad is that ? My friend said that the dinner menu is pretty great and to try that sometime ( the reviews seem to mirror that sentiment ) .

"My girlfriend and I just returned from our first experience with this amazing little family run restaurant and we will definitely be back again ! The husband and wife that run the place do not have a freezer in the small kitchen , so everything is made fresh and true to the ways of traditional viet street food .

I had the vermicelli pork dish and it was as good if not better than others I have had around Dorchester . They also have about 15 flavors of bubble tea which is harder to find at the viet restaurants around here . The owner was so friendly warm and kind and him and his wife are doing things the right way from start to finish . I asked him what a item was that was wrapped in a banana leaf that was sitting on the counter when we were paying our bill and about to leave , and he told us it was sticky rice with roasted pork and a quail egg , a northern viet specialty . I was interested in trying in but since I was so full , I said , Maybe next time '' . Instead , he kindly put it in a bag to take home , `` on the house '' , which was very nice of him .

25 minute wait but hardly anyone here . I have been to several Wahlburgers in the last week in the Boston area and for some reason all Wahlburgers restaurants seem to make you wait forever to get a chair . There are 14 employees that are visible and two hosts . There are maybe 20 people here eating but they still are requiring you to wait 25 minutes to get a table to eat . Doesnt sound very profitable . Is there something wrong ? We wanted to watch the game but we could n't sit at the empty table . We had our 15 year old daughter so we had to breakup our group so the men could watch the game at the bar and the girls had to sit outside . We are talking about a Sunday afternoon at 3:30pm . I thought this restaurant was all about family . Looks like you 're just breaking up the family . Ha ha . In the photo you can see a table that is empty right behind us . Not sure why we ca n't just sit there . Do n't tell me it is because you do n't have enough workers . One other thing . This place does n't give refills on Ice T. they said we do n't give refills because we brew the tea here . I am pretty sure most restaurants brew their own Tea but still give refills . Iced T must be the cheapest drink to make . This Tina girl below says she has reached out to me . That is n't true .

"First off I want to say that I really really wanted to like this place . I am a purveyor of the nerdy arts . I consider myself a nerd and want to encourage any and all things nerd related . The first thing I noticed when I walked in was their decor . Really great . 5/5 . We looked around for a bit and after not being seated I assumed we could seat ourselves so we walked towards the window on the other side ( there\ 's a partition in the middle of the tavern )  . One of the servers in a furry animal hat came to seat us . She kind of pushed us back from where we were walking ( towards the left side ) and went to seat us on the right side of the bar . I asked her if we could be seated by the window , and her response was there\ 's only seats for 4 by the windows . '' Um , ok . There were four window seats , and three were empty , and one of them even had TWO people sitting at it ! ! Honestly , it was about 2:10 pm , and they only had about five or so tables occupied- plenty of open tables . Strike one . She also seated us on the side of the tavern she wasn\'t serving , so we got a different server . My boyfriend at that point was already kind of offended at that and wanted to leave , but I really wanted to give them a chance , so we stayed . He ordered their cheap beer , Caribou Lager , at $ 3 . 50 , I ordered a caesar and we both ordered a sandwich ( mine without the bread , which she acknowledged to be gluten-free when she took our order ) . All food is $ 6 , which is good , but the portions are fairly small . She came back saying that they were out of Caribou Lager from last night . So she suggested another beer , all which were more expensive ( by about $ 2 . 25 ) . Strike two . I got my caesar , and I am 90 % sure that they either forgot to add the liquor to my drink , or that their vodka is extremely watered down . I even had my boyfriend try it and he agreed . Normally I can feel my liquor ( even if its a single ) if I haven\'t eaten and I didn\'t feel the liquor at all . Strike three . We got our food , and although I had asked for no bread for my sandwich , there it was in all its glutinous glory . I just removed them and ate my meal . Strike four . Four strikes ! I really really really wanted to like this place . I wanted to come here with my nerdy friends , pretend I\ 'm at the Stormwind Inn and drink mead , but I am pretty sure that I am never coming back again . I am so very disappointed by my experience today . I don\'t know if it was because I didn\'t look nerdy enough , or they had an off day , but it was my first time there and the whole time we were there I just felt awkward and unimpressed . This visit also left me in a seriously sour mood for the rest of the afternoon .

"I almost always go to Starring Rolls Cafe when I visit the studios since its conveniently located near many of the headliner attractions . Its a good place to go after riding Tower of Terror and Rockin Roller Coaster for breakfast or a snack . Most of the breakfast offerings are carb-centric ; they have a selection of bagels , muffins , turnovers , and cookIes - though they do have fruit and yogurt as well . Additionally , they have a selection of desserts . One drawback to this place is the layout - when you enter you 're immediately at the front of the line so you have to go to the back of the cafe amongst the crowd of people to get to the food . There are multiple counters so navigation can be choppy . Overall the crowds do not flow gracefully which makes it hectic during peak times . Overall , Starring Rolls is average ; nothing too fantastic but not low quality either .

"Eh . I just dont know . We went to New World on a random weekday evening in the spirit of trying new places . The small restaurant/deli has a nice location on the north end of Guadalupe ...  . many , many UTers ( on the bus , on the bike , in the car ) pass by the little strip of shops on their way toward campus . Despite the free publicity , the place was completely dead . When we walked in 45 minutes before close , 3/4 of the dining room had been closed . The owner was talkative and friendly , encouraging us to order this or that from the menu . I decided on the chicken & cheese sub , which was the definition of mediocre . The bread fell apart , the cheese was too much , the cooked vegetables were limp and slimy . Corinne had a veggie sandwich and really enjoyed it . As we sat at the one table that had not been cleaned and chair-topped for the night , one other person patronized the deli . The prices are moderate for a sandwich and drink . I have no idea what kind of lunch crowd they cater to , but it 's kind of disheartening that a place with such good intentions ca n't seem to draw a dinner crowd . I sincerely hope they are able to do some marketing and get some guests . I would be willing to try New World again , and I hope others will give it a go , too .

"Went for lunch as a one , and was ignored by a waiter while the party of two behind me was offered seating . They spoke up and got another seater to acknowledge me and seat me . Unfortunately I got the same guy as my waiter . He was distracted and a tad hostile . He put more energy into pulling up his sagging pants than to service . Everyone has a bad day and I did not complain to management nor undertip him , but the front of the house could use a lot of work . The food is not special enough to have to put up with bad service . I will try takeout .","service, food, waiter, He","Negative, Negative, Negative, Negative",Restaurant
"I\ 've never stopped at this establishment once . I haven\'t had the pleasure in any shape , form or fashion of having their food at this location on Guadalupe . However I just called to ask a simple question which would have helped me choose a dinner spot . You see my Wife is a big soup fan ... ...  . it varies depending on the season/flavor . On the website it states their main staples and says check the chalk board for other flavors . I can\'t do that over the phone and called at 5:59 p.m. simply to ask what flavors they had today . In this day and age I notice most people answer the phone in establishments and give no name only a generic this is { insert name here } . You may/may not get how may I help you . I politely said good evening ma\'am what soups do you have on the menu this evening . She communicated the choices and I replied thank you Ma\'am and I hear on the other the sound of a phone being hung up before I could finish my sentence . Listen customer/potential customers should be able to ask you a question . I mean God I don\'t believe I inconvenienced her by asking a quick question . I\ 'm on Yelp researching soups and this place came up ... ... ... forgive me for ever trying to solidify making your establishment a dining choice . To you whomever you are that answered the phone keep up the good work with your terrific phone etiquette . Next time my office decides we\ 're having a luncheon I\ 'll be sure to tell everyone if we want soup/sandwiches etc . catered to not even bother looking at this place .","place, Ma\'am","Negative, Negative",Restaurant
"First visit wasnt bad , and I can easily see how it might make fours stars on my next visit . My chicken wrap was flavorful , and unique compared to most Mediterranean restaurants . But it was just the wrap , with no sides , for something like $ 8 . It 's a bit much considering they 're not as big as you would get elsewhere . But as I said , the flavors are good . For an extra $ 2 or so you can get a meal , so I 'll be trying that next time . It 's a pretty good location too , centrally located downtown . When the weather is good the large windows are open , and it 's comfortable inside . I 'll be back to try something hopefully a little more filling , and we 'll see where the rating goes from there .","most Mediterranean restaurants--chicken wrap, most Mediterranean restaurants--chicken wrap--flavors, location, most Mediterranean restaurants, inside","Mixed, Positive, Positive, Mixed, Positive",Restaurant

"I used to live really close to this space and anticipated its opening . I was happy that they opened before I moved but sad that I had to move away . I wandered past on my way home and they were open and since I didnt feel like cooking I opted to see what they had to offer . There are starter options , sandwich wraps and dinners . The dinners come with a main component and sides . I tried the Kibbee balls -- they are football shaped fried mixture of cracked wheat that is stuffed with ground beef -- - they were tasty . The really friendly owners also offered me a taste of the Babba so i used that to dip it in - even tastier . I opted for a wrap - it was huge . It was the falafel wrap in the traditional pita . I was so happy that they were using a really thin pita - think they said that it is a typical syrian bread . You can also opt for another option - looks more like a lavash and maybe a whole grain -- ca n't remember . I really enjoyed the falafel . I loved the flavors and sauces inside . I was able to chat with the counter person as well as the owner who is preparing the food . They were very nice . Loved all the info they shared about the food , etc ... They have a case that will be filled with more treats - savory and/or sweet . There is/are ( an ) other falafel option ( s ) in Davis but very different . I like both options but , again , they are VERY different -- you decide which you prefer or is better . I like NOOR 's flavors and the pita in their falafel and it is HUGE ! You can actually split it with someone and enjoy a starter or two . If you are in Ball Square , Powderhouse Square , Teele Square , Davis Square or Tufts area I recommend checking them out . You can also dine inside - think maybe about 15 seats or take to enjoy back in the comfort of home .","space, Kibbee balls, space--treats, space--sauces, space--falafel--syrian bread, space--NOOR ', wrap, space--falafel, space--counter person, space--Babba, space--syrian bread, space--flavors, space--owner","Positive, Positive, Positive, Positive, Positive, Positive, Positive, Positive, Positive, Positive, Positive, Positive, Positive",Restaurant

Unfortunately , though , the food was pretty mediocre . I ordered the Beef Iskender , and as you can see in a lot of pictures on here , it comes with doner kabob meat mixed in tomato paste on top of a layer of cut up bread ( kind of hidden underneath ) . The plate also comes with a side of yogurt and oily rice . After your meal , you get a cup of tea and a small piece of dessert , which is actually pretty refreshing ( and I wish I had asked what it was called ! )  .

"Holy cow . Smashburger is a religious experience . Their burgers are heavenly : grilled with science , made with muscle , and a savory meal from start to the last bite of buttery bun . Kevin P. and I got to attend a Blogger Bash at Smashburger before it opened on July 7 . We got to go back in the kitchen to learn how to smash a burger . These burgers start as a fluff ball '' of 100 % Angus Beef that\ 's laid across a grill slathered in butter . Yes , at Smashburger , they sear their burgers in butter ! This forms a delicious , caramelized layer on the burger . It\ 's a burger not for the faint of heart because all the grease is cooked right back into the meat . After grilling , the Smashburger is placed between two buttered buns ( more butter keeps the bun from falling apart around the burger ) and topped with your choice of ingredients . I had the Atlanta Burger : might tasty with Peach BBQ sauce , Wicken Pimena Cheese , cole slaw , and grilled jalapenos . I\ 'd never had grilled jalapenos before and they were spicy with a steady level of heat . To cool off my palette , I had a NutterButter shake which was one of the best milkshakes I\ 've had in this town . Smashburger has everything I\ 've ever wanted that Five Guys couldn\'t provide : beer , wine , shakes and more sides . We sampled the sweet potato fries and fried pickles , both were pretty yummy .

"Overall -- pretty darn good . In an effort to impress my best friend visiting from California , we decided on Roux for dinner on Saturday night based on recommendations from many friends ( and of course , all of you fellow Yelpers ) . It happened to be the night of the Starlight parade so our 7:30 reservation was probably not necessary . Upon our first ( of many ) drink order , we learned that they were out of the silver tequila for the margarita like cocktail that I cant remember the name of ( it included limoncello and ginger beer , yum ) . They were eager to replace it with a higher level gold tequila , so no biggie . None of the appies that I had wanted to try based on the website ( crawfish pie , hushpuppies , crab cakes ) were on the menu so we ordered the fried green tomatoes and some oysters . Neither had I tried before , so my adventurous palate was eager . Fried green tomatoes are exactly what you think they are , fried green tomatoes . Good , but unimpressive . The oysters . They are served 3 ways , we chose the Gratinee de Bienville . Now , anything with bacon wins my vote ( come on , even vegetarians like bacon and they 're lying if they tell you otherwise ) but it would be with a gun to my head if I ever put an oyster in my mouth again . I 'm big on texture ( and this has nothing at all to do with the quality of this restaurant ) so the oysters were n't a huge hit . By now we 're ready to order a bottle of wine and waitress highly recommended one of the Willamette Valley cabs as her fave so we went with it . However , she shortly returned to inform us that they had 'just sold ' the last 2 bottles . Boooo . I 'm an easy sell with wine , so finding another bottle was no challenge with our waitress 's help . Now they really need to update the website , I know that an ever changing menu keeps a place fresh , but come on . Have a better sampling on the net ! I was excited to check out the Jumbalaya , the crab stuffed trout , or the short ribs ... none of which were on the menu . So we all ordered something different , there was duck , New York strip , rabbit and pork loin on the table ! A regular farm ! Haha ... any way we all sampled a bit of everything ( which is HUGE , my friend and I are very anti-sharing , it 's why we get along ) and it was all AMAZING .

Good God they 're delicious ! ! ! ! I recommend the Moscotto D'Asti ( it 's a fave of mine ) to compliment .

"My wife and I were just spending overnight in Austin waiting for a flight to Cali and we were looking for some good eats in Austin . This was our first trip to Austin and we were somewhat eager to see for ourselves what keeps Austin weird . '' Looking at Yelp , it looked like Moonshine Grill was quite popular so off we went from our hotel by the Austin-Bergstrom airport . Upon arrival , we quickly realized parking was going to be a major challenge and I wasn\'t inclined to pay $ 7 for valet parking ... so we decided to head down South Congress Ave ( SoCo ) for lunch options . We turned off South Congress and were able to secure roadside parking which was less than half a mile from SoCo Cafe . A fairly short walk and we were at SoCo Cafe . Its decor looked retro enough and we were met with friendly service . We read they specialize in brunch and later found out they\ 're known for their Bloody Mary as well as carrot cake French toast ... but we opted for the Sweet Potato beignets to start and the Denver omelet and I opted for the Crab Cake Benedict . Both the omelet and eggs Benedict were accompanied by smoked gouda potato pancake . We started out with the beignets . While decently flavored , it didn\'t quite evoke memories of us sitting at Cafe du Monde looking out towards Jackson Square while savoring their beignets . The Denver omelet was stuffed with sliced Niman ranch ham that was full of flavor accompanied by caramelized onions , roasted Poblano peppers and white cheese . My Crab Cake Benedict had perfectly poached eggs sitting on crab cake medallions , with its crisp exterior , and topped with bits of crispy bacon and chipotle hollandaise sauce . I loved my dish as well as the potato pancake served with it . I can still picture the egg yolk gently oozing into the crab cake , forming a delectable flavor combination . My wife also liked her dish , commenting about how it was bursting with flavors . The cafe\ 's ambiance seemed a bit understated ... nothing to write home about .

"I enjoy this place - despite the fact that the interior looks like it was decorated with the dumpster remnants leftover from a house featured on Hoarding : Buried Alive '' . The food is decent , the staff are reasonably competent , and smokers are appropriately relegated outdoors to blaze in remote isolation . It really doesn\'t get any better than that , folks . Food : Thinking Man Tavern specializes in casual American bare fare , including appetizers , soups , salads , sandwiches , and burgers . All sandwiches and burgers are accompanied by your choice of side - options include black beans and rice , potato rounds , mashed cayenne sweet potatoes , sauteed green beans , red beans and rice , side salad , roasted corn salad , or roasted squash and zucchini . I typically always order the same thing whenever I find myself here - the fried green tomato sandwich on ciabatta with a side of potato rounds . The sandwich is sizable and the ingredients are always fresh . The potato rounds are also particularly enjoyable - I haven\'t had anything quite like them anywhere else in Atlanta . Atmosphere : The physical space is somewhat dark and dreary - the series of taxidermied animals that line the walls are also mildly disturbing . However , the clientele is always energetic and lively , which makes for a generally pleasant experience . The bar does have multiple TV\ 's above the bar area for those preferring to avoid human interaction . Service : The staff here are by no means the epitome of congeniality or efficiency , but they do eventually get the job done . They\ 're also willing and able to separate checks for groups - a feat that an increasing number of Atlanta restaurants are no longer inclined to do .

"Worst B dubs in central Ohio and beyond ! We love BW-3 but not this location . Stopped in to order food to go on a slow Wednesday night . Tons of open tables in the restaurant and bar . After ordering for and paying for our food we headed back to the bar to sit and have a drink or two while waiting for our order . Soon after sitting down a hostess came to the table to tell us that all tables in the bar area have to be seated by the hostess . We started laughing thinking this was a joke since it is ludicrous and no other BW-3s ( or restaurants with a separate bar area ) does this . We looked around at all of the empty tables and asked her if she was serious ? She said you can sit at the bar ( which has around 12 seats and was almost full ) but all tables must be seated . So what she wanted us to do was go back up to the front so someone could walk us back to a table ! Are you kidding ? ! First of all , have a sign in the area that says so OR if you are not busy whatsoever you can check In with people politely and explain that normally this is the case just to make sure customers are taken care of so she will let our waitress know or something . To actually tell customers who have ordered and paid for food and are actually sitting to buy a few drinks while waiting ( with tons of open tables in the bar ) that they must get up , walk up to the hostess stand to be officially seated was rude . We did not do that , we did wait by the door and leave immediately following . Our food took over thirty minutes so we definitely would have a couple of drinks each . We wont be back ever to this BW-3s even if it is the only place open within 50 miles .","location, BW-3--hostess, BW-3, place, it","Negative, Negative, Mixed, Negative, Negative",Restaurant
"Seasoned fries with truffle aioli was absolutely delish . Unfortunately , we were not able to enjoy the Korean Hot Wings due to it being undercooked . From the first bite/taste , it is hot wings not BBQ style ( not sweet ) if that helps . Chimichurri Skirt Steak was muy deliciosio . If you love/crave fajita steak then this your choice of steak done medium-well . Bibimbap with steak with over-easy on top was so yummy . The spicy sauce comes on the side -- If you or your tummy cant handle spicy foods then I suggest you control the heat instead of the server stirring in the spice in your bibimbap . I love the few crunchiness I got from the bottom part of the rice when mixed altogether . Off the menu drink that I highly suggest is the Bellini Slush topped with Sangria that hits the spot . It paired perfectly with my spicy dish -- keeping me cool .

Atmosphere consists of a rickety deck and giant propane tank ( but hey , if we were always picky about ambiance we wouldnt be Cartlandia ) . Turkey was on-point with fresh brioche bun and beans were good ; the smoked corn salad was like eating smoke in solid form ( which I did n't like at first but it grew on me ) . Maybe throw a dollop of mayo on that bad boy to smooth it out . You can go inside the 76 and choose from a selection of beverages . Could be much improved by offering plates rather than sammies only ; I would have liked to sample other meats but did n't want a pair of sandwiches .

We also watched while four staff members sat at the bar eating and drinking their beers . We waited for our sandwiches '' for an hour and ten minutes .

I ended up sitting at a table for over 15 minutes with no one coming to take my order . After my friend showed up we decided to go elsewhere . Later on we decide to go back at around 10 . It was less crowded and a lot easier to get drinks . For some reason they close the patio there early because after awhile someone came and kicked us off of it .

"Im rating Maenam 3 . 5 stars , because although it was fairly good , I wo n't return . Here 's why ... We were a big group of people , so the set menu was a given . We started with a tuna salad topped with coriander , greens , cashews and a lemon grass dressing . Not authentic Thai but it was an interesting take . The fried prawn balls were n't tender , actually quite chewy . Some people might dig that . Mussels were awesome , I really liked them - fresh , simple , delightful . Then came the curries . I liked the red curry with prawns but it really tasted more Indian than Thai to me . The green curry was too peppery from total green peppercorn overload . Quite good but not authentic or great . My favourite dish was definitely the white fish with a dark soy sauce dressing . Savory , meaty , fresh . I 'm thinking it 's cod , but I 'm not entirely sure . And fluffy rice to go with it is a definite plus for me , I like perfectly cooked jasmine rice with Thai food . However , I really did n't care for the Pad Thai at all . There was nothing memorable about it . And in my opinion , if you 're going to put Pad Thai on the menu , it jolly well be outstanding . It is the yardstick for any Thai establishment . Otherwise , do n't do it . So why then would n't I return to Maenam ? For $ 40/pax , the menu failed on execution , like all the ingredients are right but there 's just something missing ...

"I am a big fan of Robert DelGrande , who developed the menu for Soleil . He is truly a genius of the Texas chef\ 's brigade , not to mention something of a prince . His contribution at once surprised me when I looked at the menu on line . It seemed strangly boring . But then again , DelGrande is known for putting mac and cheese or chicken liver pate on a menu , and then wowing you with a rich component of the menu option . Surprisingly , the menu was more extensive in real life , and I suppose the online version was more truncated . We opted for the fried calamari , and baby , you have not had calamari like this before ! Thick tenderloins cut into wide strips , not rings , lightly battered and flash fried gives way to a most savory , succulent fish , and the garlic aoli was a home run , with its tangy finish . For dinner , I chose the clam pizza , and I found it better than expected because the quality of the ingredients were second to none , and the crust was fired perfectly . The very generous waiter enjoyed talking with us , and responded well , when I showed actual interest in his narrative , his background , and his desire to deliver and gain feedback . The downer was the tiramisu . The term means pick me up , '' but this was a real downer , and I am surprised the recipe came from DelGrande\ 's think tank . It was like eating a slice of whipped cream with very little complexity , almost no ladyfingers , or espresso . Topped with cocoa , this dessert was no worth the calories , and the pastry chef would be wise to rethink this one .

"Great unpretentious place to get together for an adult night out with friends . If you are looking for a cocktail lounge or a place that is going to be full of wantabee hipsters go back into Austin on 4th/6th street . Kids are not allowed after 8pm .

I personally think the wait staff if just fine . They are very relaxed and nice . They know when to come and asist you and when to leave you alone . If they are busy just walk up to the bar and get your own drink . What 's the big deal ? I have never had a waitress make me feel unwelcome or be rude to me ( since I am only drinking sodas ) .

I have always dealt with a male bartender or my waitress . The three stars is because in all honesty the food is not that great . It is just bar food . We usualy go on Wednesday , steak night . This is a great meat and potato meal for 15 . 00 . Get the salad too and two people can share . The bar is hidden toward the back of the strip mall behind waterloo and mandola 's which is a shame because I bet alot of people do n't see it .","bar--food, bar, wait staff, bar--meat, bar--outdoor area, bar--potato meal","Negative, Mixed, Positive, Positive, Positive, Positive",Restaurant
"I read the reviews before I went . I found this establishment to be a 5 Star restaurant . The decor was interesting and made me feel like I was in a top shelf place . The staff was wonderfully attentive and caring . Yes , the place is packed and therefore noisy , yet in a manner that was not a problem . Interesting people in an interesting place , if you will . The food matches the rest of the place ; top shelf . Yes , you will wait for your meal as everything is done from scratch . The challenge is not to load up on the excellent bread and oil , as it is a meal in itself . Drinks were promptly brought . Hats off to the Sangria , a drink easily screwed up . Theirs was simply perfect , refreshing and a hint of the greatness to come . Caesar salads were brought ; cold , crisp and delicious . I ordered the Hanger Steak . It arrived cooked perfectly , accompanied by creamy garlic mashed along with leaf spinach in a butter garlic drizzle . The chicken dishes were equally superb . We shared Tiramisu for dessert . A perfect end to a perfect meal . Yes the place can be tough to get into , so plan ahead . It will become readily apparent why it is so successful and why , apparently , most people who come here become regulars . It really is that good .

"I traveled all the way to Boston and was pleasantly surprised to find a Hennessys ! The one I 've been to in Hermosa Beach is quite different , but they each have their own individual charm . What I really liked about the Boston location was that the bartender and a few of the waitresses were actually Irish . This added a nice authentic touch . I stopped in twice during my trip , and although each time was around lunch , it was n't that packed . I was kinda hoping for a packed Boston bar experience , but there 's always next time . The food was really good for a bar . The lobster roll was n't overly covered in mayo and had a good amount of lobster . We also had some oysters and clam chowder - all just as delicious .

"The food was delicious . The 1/2 price wine on Monday night was a great deal . The back patio was ambient . The hostess was delightful and seemed genuinely pleased to greet us and bid us farewell . Why Three stars ? Our server seemed annoyed to serve us . We were not told of any features or what to expect . This is a touristy area , you should probably expect non-locals to dine in your establishment . She seemed annoyed when we asked about any of the dishes . I cant put my finger on it , but I 'm guessing she pre-judged my little group consisting of my boyfriend , my 16 year old son , his friend and myself as below the venue , especially considering the fact that we all looked a little ragged for wear . My BF and I have been in the service industry for decades between us , and we have both learned not to stereotype our tables . We tipped 20 % , but her attitude did not deserve it . I doubt she learned any lesson about stereotyping tables , sadly . We will be back , if we visit the area again , but we will be sure to ask for a different server .

"This was my first meal in Austin , and I must say , I was very very impressed . We made a reservation for 4 on a Saturday night at 6:30 pm . We waited about 10 minutes before we got seated . The bar area is really cute , plenty of chairs and the restaurant was decorated casually , but chic . We had eaten at Smittys and Kruez 's in the day , so we were n't very hungry . This is what the bf and I ordered : - goat cheese salad : the salad was amazing - the leaves were fresh , and I loved the dressing . I love goat cheese so there 's not much to be said about that but it was very good . The prosciutto on top added a very nice touch . I do think that the dressing was a *little* too much , so you might want to ask for dressing on the side if you 're particular about that sorta thing . - sea bass gnocchi : this dish took my breath away . My friend and I both ordered this , and we were completely amazed . The sea bass was so buttery and fresh , and the potato gnocchi was ... TDF . I 've never had such good gnocchi . - toffee brownie with amy 's mexican vanilla ice-cream : this completed our meal very nicely . Yes , it was rich , but it was SO worth it . The toffee bits complemented the brownie and ice-cream very well . My friend 's bf got the lobster ravioli , which he said was delicious as well .

"We went to Grotto for dinner the weekend of Valentines Day . We made a reservation the week before and they called us the day before to make sure we coming , which shows either that theyre caring , or extremely busy and want to make sure all of their tables are full . Grotto is hidden away on Bowdoin , but I think that adds to its character ( just be sure not to fall down the steps into the restaurant ) . The restaurant itself is super small but very romantic . The wine selection was good , but it 's a small place , so I ca n't imagine they have a large wine cellar . Our waitress was pretty attentive and she brought us delicious bread to start . We began with the fondue which was fantastic . The steak ( yes , dip the steak in cheese ) was cooked perfectly and tasted so good I almost ordered it for my dinner . Then we had beef tenderloin and the bolognese . The tenderloin was good but not nearly as good as the steak tips that came with the fondue . It was my first experience with bolognese , and I should have waited to try it some other time ( or never ) . While I 'm sure in other bolognese circles this might have been considered good , I will stay away from those circles if at all possible .

The mochi , however , is very good ( I appreciate the variety of coffee ice cream flavors in particular ) and not something you see at every bubble tea place .

"I have not been to Bar Louie in years but recently someone I met was raving about their Tuesday Burger happy hour . This new location was previously a Tony Roma and sits in a cluster of restaurants right outside the Intl airport on 436 where it intersects with 528 . As I entered I was instructed to sit anywhere and chose a high tip near the window where I could see the TVs over the bar . The burger special is $ 5 any burger except the bullet bourbon spiked burger is six dollars . They come with fries or tots and are dine in only . I ordered two burgers and requested they cut them in half . They have some nice half price apps and the wine in happy hour is 4 . 25 and includes name brands off the menu not house brands . They were not large pours but my Pinot Grigio was so good . The bullet bourbon spiked burger has all kinds of stuff on it , bacon , cheese , cream cheese and the sauce is on the side . The menu says you must be 21 to order but honestly it is a condiment . Great sandwich . The other burger I ordered was the Chicago Stockyard . Again a lot of toppings but with Worcestershire sauce I was expecting a flavorful burger but it was bland . I am from Illinois and was expecting this to be a favorite but it was a miss . The fries and tots were good and I ordered one of each . With the burger special your only choice is one of the fried potatoes . Service was excellent and my server was attentive and kept checking if I needed anything and offering drinks . She saw I was not eating both burgers and brought to go boxes for my food . I was anticipating a possible issue to take the remains since it is dine in but no problem . My husband loved the burgers and fries . I will be back to try some appetizers and other menu options .

Bartenders are great and quick with drinksMy only qualm , and it as of just recently , is the Fri/Sat nite crowd ; my new haircut city . So you have to get there before 10pm and split once they start rolllling in . You have to check out reggae brunch , great food ( not any of that fois gras crap )  . All in all great place , check it out .","place--John, place--reggae brunch, place--food, place--Bartenders, place, place--sports decor, place--buffalo wings, place--crowd, place--pitchers of beer","Positive, Positive, Positive, Positive, Mixed, Positive, Negative, Negative, Negative",Restaurant
"Found Mangieris with the Urbanspoon app as my girlfriend and I could not settle on a place to go for lunch . We checked it out .

Since it was our first time , they explained their menu and options to us and answered all our questions . I got a supreme pizza and my girl got a pepperoni and something else calzone . We were both quite impressed with out meals . I 'd definitely recommend it for dates , small groups and times when you want to indulge .

"I read a lot of posts saying get there early , but exactly how early does one really have to be ? Dropped my kiddo off at Sunday school and headed over to Snooze . We checked in at 9:15 and were told there would be a 30 minute wait for a two person table . It was 10AM before we were seated , and Im fairly confident that we were only seated because my partner and I kept checking the time . We had a 2 hour window for an adult , grown up breakfast sans kid and we spent 45 minutes waiting , so that was a huge disappointment . That we were seated at 10AM was perfect timing since booze is n't sold before then . More on that in a bit . The seating issue could have easily been managed if the restaurant had heaters for their outdoor seating . I absolutely prefer to sit outdoors , especially when I do n't have my noise sensitive little one in tow , so I would 've opted for an outdoor spot had heaters been provided . It 's kind of silly to not have them , especially with our crazy , unpredictable Texas weather . As for the rest of it -- Our server was friendly and efficient . I loved the decor and lighting . Despite a very busy and crowded inside seating area , the noise was n't at all bothersome - no need to shout at the person across from me , so that was excellent . The pineapple upside down pancake was superb . The plate sizes were a little too big for me . Most of the egg dishes that appealed to me came with three eggs , and if you wanted a pancake to go with it ( which of course I did ) , you could swap out your toast for an additional $ 4 . I like to eat , but three eggs , hash browns , bacon AND a pancake ? That 's a bit much , even for more . Some smaller plate options would 've been great . I ordered a mimosa as well , which I have to say was oranger than Donald Trump . Seriously , I wanted to ask for a side of champagne to go with it , so that was a huge disappointment . I think I 'll check if they do take out , so I can avoid the wait and make my own mimosas at home .","egg dishes, outdoors, server, plate sizes, pineapple upside down pancake, inside seating area, lighting, noise, decor","Positive, Positive, Positive, Negative, Positive, Negative, Positive, Positive, Positive",Restaurant

"to be fair I like to go somewhere more than once before writing a review . My very first experience here was as follows : Party of two , seated in the dining room . I am actually hard of hearing and I found the place to be incredibly loud for a Saturday afternoon . Server was kind , not exceptional but she did come by one to check in . Menu had great variety as far as sauces go . Mango Lemonade was way overpriced and nearly too sour to drink . I had the Pork Sliders with Asian Zing sauce . Sauce was wonderful , spicy , sweet and flavorful . The buns were stale/dry but I think it was the pork that ruined it . After the second bite I felt like I had smoked a cigarette . I am fairly certain that someone in the kitchen slipped and poured the whole bottle of liquid smoke on this pork . The coleslaw was watery and without flavor , it was crunchy , wet and white . The onion rings I had were fabulous- but when is anything fried bad '' ? My son loved his ribs and wings . I will try them again and repost . But as far as first experiences go . I am not too impressed . Summary : Areas needing improvement : flavor of pork sliders . tasters in the kitchen to adjust the lemonade .

"Alright , Im really confused about all the negative reviews of this place . I would exclusively order their chicken fingers , never bothered with anything else . The breading was always crispy , never soggy , and never too thick . It sort of flaked off in places , but the spice mixture they used was there in every bite . I 'm not great at discerning the different herbs in a mixture , but there was definitely some cayenne mixed in to give it just a small bit of heat . The chicken always ALWAYS tasted fresh and was usually quite juicy . Only once or twice did an order arrive that was a little dry on the inside . I do n't know . Maybe everyone ordered wings that sucked , or the sandwiches were poorly done . Personally , I 'd take the leftovers and heat up 2 of them with a slice of pepperjack cheese and make a spicy bistro sauce and have that on a sandwich bun . Almost better than the chicken itself . But at any rate , the place sits empty now , a For Lease sign in the window . Hope you 're happy , Old North .

"The first time I ever went to Pollo Campero was in Guatemala , where this chain originated . I was volunteering at an orphanage and my group paid for an outing for the kids to go to the local fire station and then for chicken . The kids were so excited and once I got there I found out why . This chicken is unbelievable . It is crispy beyond belief . It also isn\'t seasoned or breaded heavily the way some US chains are . It is really more about scalding the chicken at such a high temperature that the skin becomes super crunchy . When I lived in Chicago , they had a PC there and I was absolutely ecstatic when I got lost in Chelsea and found this one . I went today with my cousin and we ordered several pieces of dark meat , Campero rice , plantains and the new 99 cent crisper '' . Like I expected , the chicken was amazing . The rice was nice and flavorful , with peas , carrots and a lovely mild spice . The plantains were warm and sweet with sour cream for dipping . The `` crisper '' was new to the menu and really good ! Basically a stewed chicken with tomato and onions wrapped in a tortilla and deep fried . Yummy . PC has yucca fries , beans and regular fries for more sides . They also have grilled chicken and some other creative menu items like salads and bowls . They also have Horchata , Tamarindo and Jamaica drinks . I can\'t wait to try the grilled chicken . The only thing missing from the menu is the tostones : ( While I knew I was going to have awesome chicken , I was really happy at how clean the restaurant was and kind the employees were . The manager even walked around the restaurant checking on everyone to make sure their meals were perfect . Someone said it is pricey , and I do not agree .

"My Australian boyfriend was dying to watch the Australian vs Pakistan cricket test and a friend told us about an Indian restaurant that was open 24/7 and always played the cricket , House of Dosas . He called them to make sure they had the test on TV and was answered with You like cricket ? If you come here we will treat you like a King ! '' by the owner , his excitement almost palpable as he launched into the current score and some game highlights . My boyfriend laughed and said we would be there soon to have some beers . When we arrive the place was busy for a Tuesday night but we were quickly whisked to a table with prime viewing location for the cricket . We drank a fair few beers and ate some delicious appetizers . The coconut chutney they serve with their curries is so fresh and delicious and the `` gravy '' that comes with their naan bread is so flavoursome that I think I dreamt about it that night . I saw the Dosas coming out of the kitchen and was amazed - those things are huge ! ! We had a great evening and the owner only charged us half price for our beers . We came back the next night and had a full dinner , which was some of the most delicious and well-priced south Indian food I have ever sampled . We were greeted like old friends by the staff and owner . The $ 9 . 00 vegetarian thali special was outrageous - about 10-12 samples of different vegetarian curry delights in their own individual silver ramekins served with naan bread ... perfect for someone like me who has little to no ability to make a decision , just let me taste a little bit of everything ! The owner came out again and poured us complimentary glasses of Crown as a nightcap and we rolled home very full , very happy and with money still in our pockets . Great food , good atmosphere , really lovely genuine service .","place--vegetarian thali special, place--dinner, place--appetizers, place--coconut chutney, place--owner, place--south Indian food, place--food, place--things, place, place--staff, place--atmosphere, place--naan bread--gravy, place--service","Positive, Positive, Positive, Positive, Positive, Positive, Positive, Positive, Positive, Positive, Positive, Positive, Positive",Restaurant

"Only legit Korean food in town . Mom and Pop stop shop . Mom does the cooking and the dad serves . I am Korean and eat Korean at home 4x or more times a week . Can you get better Korean in Portland ? Absolutely ! Can you get better Korean in Vantucky ? Absolutely not ! The comments about there being no short ribs ( flanken style chuck ribs ) are incorrect , and they dont charge you for sides unless you 're a cheap ass ordering one dish for your entire family and trying to feed them with free sides . It 's like ordering a hot dog for a family of four and complaining that they stopped giving us sauerkraut and ketchup packets to feed the rest of the family . Yes , they do sell your typical teriyaki but ask for the yellow Korean menu . There are plenty of stews and other dishes . I would recommend the hand cut noodles like Jah Jang myun , Kal kook soo , and try the beef rib soup ( kalbee tang ) with some bulgogi ( marinated thinly sliced ribeye ) . They have fish but it 's mackerel from Norway which most people find to be too oily and fishy . The prices for meat dishes are a little on the higher side but if you do n't want to waste the time to drive to PDX , it 's a local business to support . Without it , we are limited to only one other joint in downtown Vancouver which is like comparing a coffee shop to a Brazilian BBQ . Totally different Korean food . It 's not fancy but a good example of two people trying to make it in the US through hard work and integrity . If you can overcome the communication barrier and not be an A-hole , it will open up a whole new world for you at restaurants .

I go there so much I do n't even order anymore they just know . I always order the chicken barg with rice and salad . The chicken is skewered and charred beautifully and the basmati is perfectly fluffy and buttery with the most amazing flavor that 's hard to replicate . The salad is simple with a red wine vinegarette but refreshing and crunchy with the rice and chicken . The salmon is really good too , as well as the lentil soup is so comforting and tasty . I LOVE the baklava . It 's like no other , not overly sweet and syrupy . You can tell the butter has been patiently browned and the layers are perfectly crispy bathed in the buttery sauce and toasted pistachios .

My favorite is the grilled octopus . My first experience was when I sat at the bar and the overall was at least a 3 for service and food . BAD : This weekend \'Easter Weekend not so much . My friends and I sat in the patio area and we preceded to order drinks ( as we had to get them from our self ) as there was no sever . We ordered food ( and the bartenders basically auctioned off our food and said here it is as we had to go fetch it ? ? I have to say that there were 4 bartenders and 1 bar back form what I can see . So if you are not busy why wouldn\'t you provide your paying customers with a good experience ? We had 3 drinks and 3 apps then left and headed to another establishment . The owners are in the restaurant bushiness and own other locations , so for the bartenders to say that this is how we do it and they said they do not serve the customers who sit in that area who are they to tell a buying customer their set of rules . Basically they were NOT busy so they should have offered to walk out the food and drink . They are in the service industry right ? In Atlanta you get only a few chances and if you don\'t perform the customers wont come back .
