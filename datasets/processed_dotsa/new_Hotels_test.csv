"Everything s perfectly the same as Penny describes and the same as In the picture , clean and comfortable Penny is really nice and gave me some suggestions for my visit In Boston . Public traffic is very convenient in Boston and even from Penny s house to Downtown Newbury street the most fancy one in Boston . And Jamaica plaint is a quiet safety residential area .

"Tiffany 's place is magnificently located , right next to the state house . Really close to everything . The Building is well maintained , but showing some signs of wear . The apartment is a little smaller than I was expecting and the ladder to the loft bedroom is a little scary at first . I was a little taken back initially , but then the place grew on me . Tiffany is lovely and left , milk , eggs , coffee . All in all a really good experience .","apartment, apartment--ladder to the loft bedroom, apartment--Tiffany","Mixed, Negative, Positive"

"Tiffany 's place is just as described . The location is unbeatable in Boston , right on Boston Common and two minute walk to the nearest T .  The apartment is comfortable for 2 and I would imagine a tight squeeze for 4 . You do have to climb up a wooden ladder to get up to the bedroom but the bedroom is actually larger than I had expected , just watch out for the low ceiling ! I would recommend and would definitely stay here again","apartment--bedroom, apartment--bedroom--ceiling, apartment, apartment--location","Mixed, Negative, Mixed, Positive"
"Valerie and Jason are good hosts . Valerie is very easy to contact before , and during the trip . Jason gave us a map of Boston with recommendations . There is a mini fridge in the room , which was great . They do have a small breakfast offered each morning , which was nice . The only drawbacks are the shared bathroom , 2 floors down , and that the room shares a thin wall with their teenage daughter .","shared bathroom--wall, Jason, mini fridge, Valerie, breakfast","Negative, Positive, Positive, Positive, Positive"

"Kama wants guests at 90 Kilsyth to have a banner experience . The location is superb - close to B & C Green lines in a lovely , walkable Boston neighborhood . Parking instructions for Out-of-Towners ( especially West Coast people like me ) needs to be specific , include best arrival time , and Kama will now provide this crucial info . The apartment is a great value - kitchen and bathroom spaces are small , but updated ( kitchen ) and satisfactory ( bath ) . The bedroom is large and light-filled , rooftop deck & free wifi were fabulous , but the most welcome feature in July and August was the AC in the living room and bedroom ( thank you ! ) .

It is great for the younger crowd - if you are over 40 ( as we are ) , be aware that you are actually climbing up and down a ladder into a homemade loft to a mattress on a floor w/ a very low ceiling .

"Unfortunately I am unable to give a positive review of our stay over Christmas at Gloria 's place . When my family of five arrived from CA there was no heat on the upper floor of the apartment at all ( and was n't fixed for two days ) . Gloria does n't live close by so my husband had to do all the coordination with letting the heat guy in and out of the building . The house was minimally furnished , almost like someone had moved out and just left the beds and a couple of couches . Acres of empty bookshelves , only one bedside table in all of the four bedrooms , arms of chairs and couches in the living room were loose . There were no blankets on any of the beds ( only light summer comforters ) . Gloria did go out and buy blankets after we asked . There was no light in the narrow , steep stairs between the floors and it never did get fixed while we were there . The apartment was pretty dirty , despite contacting Gloria ahead of time after reading other reviews . The kitchen is very basically outfitted , with mismatched silverware and only a few cooking pots . We also discovered all the smoke detectors tossed in a cabinet and a moldy bowl of popcorn in the kitchen . Lastly , after we left we got a very rude text about putting the trash out incorrectly when we had received no specific instructions on recycling cardboard . Overall , I can not agree with the listing description that describes the place as a `` luxury apartment '' . My husband likened it to a grand old lady who had seen better days ... Gloria seemed a bit defensive and it felt like every question we had , or thing we requested , she took personally . The single plus ( and it is a big one ) is that the location is very good , near Boston Common and Charles St .  restaurants and shops . Hopefully Gloria will spend some time cleaning , furnishing and outfitting this lovely old place more completely , it really could be fabulous . We detailed our experience to Airbnb with pictures and they provided us with a nice travel credit . Very good customer service .","place--heat, place--couches, place--arms of chairs, place--silverware, Gloria--blankets, place--blankets, place, Gloria--arms of chairs, place--Gloria, Airbnb--travel credit, Gloria--Gloria, Gloria--bookshelves, Gloria--couches, Gloria--heat, place--kitchen, Gloria--light, Gloria--Gloria--text, Gloria--stairs, place--light, Gloria--location, place--bookshelves, Airbnb--customer service, place--location, Gloria--kitchen, place--stairs","Negative, Negative, Negative, Negative, Negative, Negative, Mixed, Negative, Mixed, Positive, Mixed, Negative, Negative, Negative, Negative, Negative, Negative, Negative, Negative, Positive, Negative, Positive, Positive, Negative, Negative"

"We stayed in this apartment for two days this past August ( 8/18 ) . From the time of booking until we checked out , we felt taken care of . Tiffany paid such close attention to detail by setting us up with everything . There were absolutely no surprises upon getting there because she provides the most detailed directions and instructions . She even provided information about parking nearby which we misplaced upon arriving in Boston and were frantically driving around the city looking for parking . We decided to pull over and text her in hopes that she would respond with the information ( that she had already provided ) . Within seconds she responded and told us what we needed to know . She was very courteous and kind . The apartment itself is perfectly located ... you walk out and you are in the center of Boston . It took us 30 minutes ( max ) to walk to Fenway park from the apartment and about 20 minutes or less to walk to the harbor and then , of course , there 's everything in between ( Boston common/gardens , Cheers bar , Faneuil Market ) . It 's the best location if you 're looking to park your car for the trip and walk to all of your destinations . Inside the apartment , it was very clean and well kept . The loft bedroom made it somewhat difficult for my 6ft tall 200+ pound husband ( because it 's not standing room ) , but even with his size he was comfortable and had no qualms about the sleeping arrangements . We felt safe staying there which is important to feel in a strange city . The building seemed clean , safe and secure . ALSO - do n't miss out on the gorgeous rooftop balcony . We only went there on our way to check out and I regret not going up there every night to just look at the ( Website hidden by Airbnb ) magnificent and such an added benefit in this reservation . Thanks Tiffany for a great stay !","building, building--Tiffany--directions, rooftop balcony, building--Tiffany--instructions, building--Tiffany, building--loft bedroom, building--location","Mixed, Positive, Positive, Positive, Positive, Mixed, Positive"

It was our first Air BnB experience in the US and it turned out exceptionally well . Todd 's property was in a quiet and safe neighbourhood minutes away from Harvard Business School . There were amenities in the area and it was never a problem to find food .

"Tiffany was amazing . She was extremely accommodating , she allowed us to drop our luggage off early and let us know when the apartment was cleaned so we could come back . She also let us check out late which was very helpful due to our flight time ! The pictures of the add are amazing and make the apartment look bigger than it is . The place was generally clean but the amount of dust was scary . The tub did n't appear clean and bathroom overall needed a little TLC and good cleaning . It got way too hot in the apartment as it 's controlled by the building and unable to be adjusted . We left the ceiling and standing fans on the entire time & left windows open when we were not there and at night which made it OK . The view from the balcony on 10th floor great .

The house had plenty of room for five of us .

Only down side for us at age 65 was the ladder to the loft where we slept , and not being able to stand up in it . Maybe loft apt means something different on this coast","loft apt--ladder, loft apt--location, loft apt--snacks, loft apt, loft apt--roof patio, loft apt--check in","Negative, Positive, Positive, Mixed, Positive, Positive"

"Tiffany is an excellent hostess ! She was able to let us drop our bags off earlier than the check in time which was so helpful . It allowed us several extra hours of being able to explore Boston without luggage ! Her communication was impeccable and she was very accommodating . Her loft was so much fun . The mezzanine bedroom was such a unique twist on a studio design- truly a treat : ) . Did tou forget something for your stay ? Do n't worry- chances are , Tiffany has it stocked in her studio . Toiletries , first aid kit , cooking supplies and essentials to get you started . She has coffee and power bars to get you ready for the day . You just have to show up ! The location of her studio was beyond expectation- I wish I could have given it 10 stars . Situated at the top of Boston commons in the prestigious and beautiful Beacon Hill district- you can NOT beat this location . We were able to walk almost the entirety of the Boston area from this location ! You will not be disappointed if you stay here ! We will recommend this location to friends and family .

"We really enjoyed our stay here ! It was just as we expected . The location is phenomenal and really ca n't be beat . It was honestly even better than I expected . EVERYTHING is close-by ! The place itself is very spacious . We had 7 people ( some were children ) staying there , but we had lots of family in town so we had guests over constantly and it was plenty of room . And the rooftop deck alone was worth getting this place ! Oh , and Gloria was very easy to work with . One note for anyone looking at this place who is planning to bring kids : It 's not really ideal for small children . We have a 3 year old and a 1 year old . There are 3 flights of very steep , old stairs . We rented baby gates and it was mostly fine , but still a little stressful and tricky with our wobbly 14-month-old . Plus carrying the strollers up and down every day was n't fun . Overall , it was a great experience and we would stay here again ( but maybe when the kids are a bit older ) !

"Penny was extraordinarily helpful , generous , interesting , and overall an excellent host . Her home ( and the very private guest room ) were beautiful , clean , and beyond comfortable . The view from our room was amazing , the bathroom was private , the room was spotless and the bed was perfect . The house itself is located on a quiet street that , although hidden from the hustle and bustle of Jamaica Plain , was somehow still in the thick of everything . Everything was within walking distance ; the downtown area , the Jamaica pond , shops and bars and restaurants . It never took us more than five or ten minutes to walk to the public transportation stations nearby , and from there we could go anywhere . Penny was extremely informative and knowledgeable about the area , and what places any out of towner might want to check out . We were only in town for 3 days , but heeding her advice we felt as if we saw very much the city of Boston in our short time there . She provides you with maps , a detailed booklet of info containing history and resources , and has a wealth of knowledge about the place she calls home . Penny and her son , as hosts , were warm and inviting , courteous and respectful , and just genuinely generous . There was coffee waiting for us downstairs every morning and we were welcome to anything in the fridge . Penny herself was interesting and easy to talk to , and spent time talking candidly with us about all manner of subjects , from current political events to life in general . She was engaging when it called for it , but was extremely mindful and respectful of our privacy and personal space . All in all , Penny helped to make our first trip to Boston ( and first ever experience with air bnb ) extremely enjoyable and memorable .

Location : Fantastic spot adjacent to the Mass State House and also Boston Commons , and a short walk to the subway . Bed : Comfortable , but located in a loft space where you ca n't stand up , so just be aware about the need to climb a fairly steep ladder and crouch down in the sleeping area if you have any mobility limitations . General Space : Definitely an older apartment building , with all the associated quirks ( the fridge and freezer doors are tough to open and close because they abut the wall and there 's likely been a little shifting/settling over the years , the bathroom sink did n't drain well - I had to manually pull up the drain cover in order to get it to drain ) .
