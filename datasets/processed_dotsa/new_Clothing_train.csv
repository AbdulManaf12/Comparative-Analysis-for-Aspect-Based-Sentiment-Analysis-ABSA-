"I did n't realize how much better dancing would be with decent dance shoes compared to regular heels until I tried these . They 're cute and simple , with a slight heel that works well for me since I rarely wear heels . Following the other reviewer 's recommendations , I went a full size up for these shoes . I 'm very glad I did -- they fit perfectly . These do n't seem like they 're necessarily the best quality shoes -- which is to say that I think they 're better for casual or beginning dancers who wo n't be as rough on them as professional or competitive dancers would be . As I fall firmly into the first category and only wear them for dancing , they work very well for me .","shoes, shoes--heel","Positive, Positive"

"I\ 've been eyeing these tights for a while now , and finally gave in and bought a pair . These have the shine of nylon pantyhose , yet the thickness , opacity , and durability of dance tights . Since I have fair skin , I got Light Toast . It is noticeably darker than my skin tone , but it\ 's not too big of a contrast . While they aren\'t as stretchy or soft on the skin as the Danskin microfiber tights , they do fit me comfortably . However , I would recommend that someone who is on the higher end of their size according to the manufacturer\ 's ( not Amazon\ 's ) size chart may want to go a size up for this particular style . Luckily , I\ 'm on the lower end of Size C , so I was able to wear my usual size . They also are opaque enough to hide almost any flaws in your legs , such as bruises , cellulite , or hair , if you need to shave or wax : ) At first I wasn\'t sure why these were called Ultra Shimmery tights , but then I took a flash photo of them , and they really did look ultra shimmery ! To my knowledge , these kinds of tights are usually worn for character and ballroom dance , professional cheerleading , and sports bar waitressing , but I bought them to wear with skirts and dresses , in place of pantyhose . As long as I won\'t have any flash photos taken of me , or be under any stage lights , they will not be overwhelming . While these are about three times the cost of most pantyhose you\ 'd buy at the supermarket , it is certainly a good investment for a sturdy pair of good quality , USA-made tights . The price is about the same as other shiny/shimmery dance tights , such as from Capezio and Bloch , but a lot cheaper than Wolford , the tights that Beyonce wears ( their Neon 40s , to be exact ) . The only reason why I give 4 stars instead of 5 is because I wish they came in a few more colors , especially for darker women !","tights--tights, tights--quality","Mixed, Positive"

"The tights are comfortable and look good . I like the transition foot , because I can roll the tights up and wear flip flops going to and from class . The size chart on the package is accurate , but it is different than the standard Amazon size chart for women , so be careful . If you are under 5\ ' 2 and weigh less than 130lb , you should get the S/M . If you are 5\ ' 4 but weigh 120 or less , than you probably still want the S/M . If you are 5\ ' 3 or taller and weigh at least 130lb , than you should get the L/XL . I am 5\ ' 6 and 135lb , and the L/XL size fits me fine . It would still fit me if I gained 15 lb or lost 10 lb , because it is stretchy . At a height of 5\ ' 6 you would have to be 110 lb for the S/M to fit . There are select styles of XX Large tights for people that are 6 foot tall to 6\ ' 2 and weigh up to 180lb .

The tights also wash well . I wash them with my other laundry and dry them in the dryer . They hold up great ! There is a manufactured hold on the bottom of the foot that is wonderful .

I did order these a half size up and am super glad I did ... my daughter wears a size 7 always and the 7 . 5 fits perfectly . They will be dancing in these so getting a shoe that is too big is not an option a perfectly fitting shoe is a must ... they run small ... she is only wearing knee highs so they do run small ... the quality is better than the dance studios have locally as we needed for a choir and they are comfy out of the box she said so all is good here ...,"quality, these","Positive, Positive"

"I love these tights ! I found them when I was a kid , ice skating . Standard pantyhose would tear after one use , and the remaining ribbons would cut into my feet and toes , and become imbedded as I skated , making them very painful to take off . These are thicker , and way more durable . They do n't roll at the waist like some pantyhose . I have a bit of a pantyhose fetish ... So I have tried ALL kinds . These are amazing not only for the quality and durability , but also for the shimmer , and you ca n't beat the value . I love a good shiny hose that covers any imperfection in the leg . I bought 4 pairs of these , one of each color . I have hips and booty , but my waist is quite a bit smaller , so I got size d , just because normally , you ca n't get too big a size ... I should have got a size c tho , these are comfortable in the waist , but I have a little too much material in the ankle , which is not a good look . It 's ok tho ... . Now I know , and I will just have to buy more ! I 'll use the others with boots in the winter . I recommend these to every woman ! Look at Beyonc ! That girl knows how to wear a pair of hose !

( It 's easier for me as an Amazon Prime customer to buy two and return one -- avoid the re-stocking fee )  . I 'm glad I finally broke down and bought a real deal dancing shoe like this . Regular street shoes with leather soles and ankle straps worked ok for a while but a true Capezio is much lighter , more cushioned , and just better all around for my swing and waltz dancing . Well worth the price . They are not leather but look like they will be very durable . The nude tan color gives you a nice long leg look .","shoe--price, shoe, color","Positive, Positive, Positive"

I have a hard time with sandals as they usually are stitched around the toes and the stitches rub my feet raw . These are constructed so that the front is wrapped without stitching where it tends to rub . I would like another pair or two in different colors . Great looking sandal also . Wouldn\'t hesitate to recommend to others .,"sandal--front, sandal","Positive, Positive"

"First , find a capezio size chart before ordering . The light suntan color was a perfect to match her jazz shoes which is why we chose this color .

"But ca n't give it five stars . Bought it because Naturalizer stopped making their Mai Tai shoe , which was a twin of the Mimosa . Now I find the Lifestride Mimosa is becoming scarce . Both are/were great , comfortable shoes . Why shoe manufacturers change out basic , comfortable styles is beyond me . With its low heel and soft cross straps , the Mimosa is very comfortable . I need a wide shoe and the extra wide width is tough to find in a shoe nice enough to wear to fancy events . Takes no time to break it in . It 's comfortable when I go dancing , which is eery week . I do add Dr .  Scholl 's For Her Sole Expressions insoles for a bit more cushion , but it 's not really needed . I have them in White , Black , Camel , and Red . I 'd buy more colors , but they 're not always available in my size & width . My one quibble , the reason I ca n't give these shoes five stars , is that after a year or so of intermittent wear , no more than once a week , they tend to deteriorate , fast . In one case , the elastic on the heel strap broke . That 's easy to repair . In another , though , the upper materials started to flake off ! Not sure if using spray-on cleaners to wipe off the dirt was the culprit or it 's just cheap man-made materials . It 's a disappointment and sent me looking for replacements , which are tough to find now .","Mimosa--heel, shoes, Mimosa, shoes--elastic, Mimosa--cross straps, shoes--upper materials, It","Negative, Mixed, Mixed, Negative, Positive, Negative, Positive"
"I ordered it 2 sizes large because I 've been really into that aesthetic recently . Looks great with skinny jeans or slim joggers !

I 've had these before in black and wanted navy also because they are very comfortable to wear . The only reason for the 4 stars is that this is an open sandal so it will not have the support of a closed in shoe .,sandal,Mixed

"I am very pale , especially my legs , and the color nude was pretty spot on . I\ 've read that Capezio isn\'t the greatest in quality , but at least they had a nice color selection . I\ 'm 5\ ' 4 and 102 lbs . and the S/M fits me well in the legs , but from other reviews I knew the waist was going to be small , so I\ 'm just dealing with it , but very pleased with the color .

"Bought an adult size 4 , which should translate to a child 's 2 . Fit perfectly on my daughter who wears a 13 . 5-1 . So for us , sizing down a generous full size was the right choice .

"I bought these tights for Halloween and they were perfect for my I love Lucy/housewife costume . They are much shimmery in person . Very shiny in all the pictures I took .

"This hoodie is absolutely perfect , epecially at the price that I got it for ( which I have noticed has increased ) . It 's so soft and warm and fits a bit baggy on me , which is how I wanted it .

They are what I expected . I am going to order the L/XL until I lose 10 pounds because I am on the border line on the sizing chart . The S/M is a bit tight around my fluffy waist . I am 5\ ' 4 and currently weigh about 130/135 . So I would just suggest the larger size if you are similar so you don\'t feel like it is cutting off your circulation . But I do recommend these tights . The transition option is nice too so you can wear them as leggings .,"tights, tights--transition option","Positive, Positive"
"Great product . Very , very durable . I use these in place of pantyhose when I 'm out dancing , where normal pantyhose would n't last the night .

"I bought this shirt for work . I normally wear a medium but after reading the reviews , decided to order a small . The shirt is still way too large and very shapeless .

I usually wear Small size ( from stardard size stores like Gap , Old Navy ... ) , and thinking this blouse would be too tight if ordered in Small , I purchased the Large Size , and find it too wide .

"Not the fanciest of shoes , but is exactly what I wanted ! And has become one of my favorite go-tos . A very dependable , comfortable shoe ! I have a high arch , and this shoe supports so well , you 'll forget you 're walking in heels . If you have an outfit that no shoe really matches , this one is perfect .

Also , maybe it 's because I got a different color , but these do n't seem as well made as the ones I 've gotten in the past .

I 'm very irritated with this product . It seems like a very thick tight that would not run . However I 've worn it one time period for Less Than 3 hours . When I got home and took off my dress I had a run-in it already . This is ridiculous . It was n't even on a heel or ankle or somewhere it would be rough . It was in the middle of my thigh there 's nothing rough on the the inside of my dress . My skin is smooth . So there 's no reason a run should have even happened . I 'd really like my money back considering only work one time 4 Less Than 3 hours . Way too expensive for a one-time-use . Not at all happy,tight,Negative

For a relatively inexpensive shoe , I think that they are a great value . Addendum : I now have three pairs of these shoes , in different colors . Except for the times that I need to wear sneakers , I find that I am wearing a pair of the sandals , to the exclusion of all my other shoes . Update : I now have four pairs of these shoes .

"My co-workers recommended these for work and to have a nonskid sole put on by a cobbler ( $ 22 ) . I was desperate and had them sent overnight ( $ 8 )  . They are uncomfortable to begin with and unbearable after 4 hours of wear . There is no padding or arch support . I bought inserts ( 2 X $ 8 ) but could not decide if they were more uncomfortable with the inserts or without . After 3 weeks my hip/iliac/ gluteus medius , whatever , was so sore on my left side , I can not get up from lying or sitting with out crying out in anguish ! So , after dropping $ 84 , I am going to throw them in our burn pile and laugh maniacally as they smoke , twist , and char , much like my feet for the past 3 week .

"These tights are perfect . They are soft and do not snag . My daughter is 12 and she is rough on her tights . She dances 3x a week . She still ( no matter how many times I tell her ) yanks them on too roughly and they have yet to rip or pull . The transition foot is great because she can take the tights up and over her foot to her ankle so she can wear regular shoes or sandals to dance class , then she can just pull the foot down over her toe to put her ballet slippers on . That way she does n't dirty up the foot of the tights by putting her nasty sneakers on over the tights to go to dance . : ) I have a lingerie bag hanging in the laundry room and she throws them in there after dance . I wash when the bag gets full , so I estimate each pair of tights gets washed about every other week ( she has several pairs ) . They hold up in the wash very well . I wash in the bag , cold water wash , and I lay flat to dry on one of those expandable drying racks . My 3 year old also has these tights and we 've had the same great experience with those . She is even more rough on her tights and they get washed way more often , yet they hold up just as well !","tights, tights--transition foot","Positive, Positive"

"Not a dancer but I wanted work tights that didn\'t tear after a few wearings . The tights are great quality and not as sheer as regular tights ( so they\ 're more sturdy ) they\ 're darker and more opaque which some may not like . They definitely run small . I\ 'm 5\ ' 5 and 140 , athletic build who usually buys small or medium . Based on the reviews I sized up to XL and they fit . I could probably have done a large but I was worried the waistband would be too tight ( I don\'t have a small waist ) .

"I love the way this sandal looks and fits . Well made , very comfortable . However , it does have what I think is a design flaw . The elastic on the heel strap is sewn in right at the back of the heel with rather bumpy seams , so if the strap is a bit loose , it rubs against the ankle uncomfortably . I 've had to put shoe tape over that area to prevent blisters . It might have made more sense to place the elastic to the side nearer to the instep , where it would n't be as noticeable and would n't cause any friction . A small point , but one that knocked a star off this review for me .","elastic, sandal, it","Negative, Positive, Negative"

"SIZE : I ordered both the Capezio Women 's Suede Sole Jr .  Footlight and the Capezio Women 's Jr .  Footlight Character . Both models fit me like the description from Capezio predicted ( one like street shoe size , the other half a size up ) . I normally wear a 7 . 5 . Luckily , I got free returns so that I could order several sizes and I did not have to rely on the review only , but I would recommend to order several sizes when you are unsure like me . For this one , half a size up worked for me , but it was on the big side . WIDTH : The shoe is quite narrow , which I liked because I have slim feet . Maybe that is why some people find it smaller than street shoe size or maybe the deviation from street shoe size is larger when you go up in size . One thing that is strange is that while the shoe is narrow and fit me , the band for the ankle was too wide . If you have thin ankles , you might need to make an extra hole in the fastening . FOOTBED : I preferred the footbed of the caramel colored shoes , which feel like ( fake ) leather . The black shoes have a soft bed from a fabric that feels almost like fleece and my feet sweat quickly in it . BALANCE : One issue that I have with all four pairs of Capezio shoes that I ordered ( will return 3 ) is that the heel seems to be at a slightly different angle than the front part of the shoe . So when I have my toes/the ball of the foot on the ground , the back part of the heel does not touch the ground . When I have the weight on the heels , the toes/ball of the feet do not touch the ground - which feels very unstable . Maybe this is because these shoes must also work for tap dancing ( they have a hole in the heel so that you can put a tap heel on it ) . I hope that the heel will not break because of the uneven weight distribution . I accept this , because the shoes are only 35 dollars . COMFORTABLE : Yes , the shoes are comfortable . I am not used to wearing heels and I tend to buy comfortable , high quality shoes ( like ecco or clarks ) . But I needed danceable shoes that go with a dress , and these are good for that . These shoes are comfortable enought so that I can walk and dance in them . For ballroom dancing , I would prefer the ones with suede sole ( which were not available in my size ) . The leather sole has a light perforation but I need to practice with it because it is so slick . COLOR : I preferred the black color although beforehand I had thought that the caramel color would go with more outfits . If you have pale skin like me , the caramel shoes do not look flattering .","shoes--shoe, caramel colored shoes--footbed, all four pairs of Capezio shoes--heel, leather sole, all four pairs of Capezio shoes, black color, black shoes--fabric, black shoes--bed, black shoes, suede sole, shoes--shoe--band for the ankle, shoes--shoes","Mixed, Positive, Negative, Negative, Negative, Positive, Negative, Positive, Mixed, Positive, Negative, Mixed"

"These are perfect for classes or recital time . The light pink shade is very pretty and is a pinkish white color . The opening on these tights is well finished and stretches nicely for transition to pointe or other dance . They fit true to size ( using Capezio chart ) but some people find it more comfy to order a size up , especially if the waistband bothers you . These have the old style waistband that is uncomfortable , but they made new ones that have a non-elastic knit waistband that is amazing ... ..those were not available when I bought these . I was hoping since Capezio made those they would have changed the waistband on these , but they did n't ( minus the 1 star ) .

i bought a xxl thinking i did n't want it to look see thru on my butt area . the waist was tiny had to squeeze it over my butt and hips and it squeezed on my waist . i was surprised how it was see thru on the areas i did n't want it to be . { thinking how could people fit it if they are a xxl } i wear a l/xl pants . i still love it,"pants, waist","Mixed, Negative"
"I 've purchased these shoes twice so far - for a lindy hopper , these ca n't be beat . My one complaint is that they wear out quickly . I 've worn these to dance at events in all kinds of environments - admittedly , that sometimes includes concrete floors , so I may be at fault there . Although these are n't perfect , they are VERY comfortable and I 'll be purchasing them again when my current pair is torn up .",shoes,Mixed
We love these tights for our girls . They are thick material that last long through all the dance classes our girls are involved in . Even when they end up running around in them after dance class with no shoes on and they are n't supposed to they done end up torn right after . They have so far outlasted the expensive ones we 've bought in the past . Very happy with the product .,"product, product--material","Positive, Positive"
I have had really bad luck with amazon shoes . I would like to trade them all in for a couple of items I know will fit . I am sad because I love these very much and I had great luck last year I hope Amazon and google can help,shoes,Mixed
Ordered the X large for 5 ' 7 130lbs . They are a touch large so I think i 'll order a L next time for more lift and fit . These tights are super soft and can take a beating . I thought the than I ordered would be to dark since i 'm very pale but when on they look perfect onstage . The transition tights are great for women who wear dresses in winter and want something that wo n't run or rip after three wears . They are also super warm !,transition tights,Mixed
Toe box too small . I read other reviews with the same response . I will be returning these .,"Toe box, these","Negative, Negative"
"These are very shiny , make your legs look like Barbie legs . They are great for my needs ( roller derby ) and would be great for dance . I am not sure that they would be suited for daily wear . I have very fair skin and ordered the light toast color . I would recommend this color if your skin is very fair . I am 5\ ' 4 and 110lbs - ordered size A , fits well .","color, These","Positive, Positive"
"Too bad we did n't have transition tights when I was little . I love that I can wear these over the foot or folded up on my ankle ! The fit is perfect and the color is classic light ballet pink . There is no color change in the gusset ( top part ) , so no need to worry about covering the top part conservatively .","transition tights--top part, transition tights","Positive, Positive"
"It is too narrow and way too long . I ordered the size I normally wear ( 8 1/2 . I usually wear a medium width but this time I ordered a wide because it looked narrow in the picture . Well , it was more like a narrow width even though the package said W .  The strap at the back of the shoe is NOT adjustable and it was about 1 inch too long . It did n't even come close to fitting . These shoes are poorly designed . I am mailing them right back . I will continue my search for a navy sandal with a heel that is not too high .","shoes, strap","Negative, Negative"
"This is my third purchase of the Deerskin Gore Front Moccasin . I like them so much better than the ones with the ties in front . The ties always come undone . I bought the Champagne color to wear in my healing room and keep in the house , where no shoes are allowed .","Deerskin Gore Front Moccasin, Deerskin Gore Front Moccasin--ties","Mixed, Negative"
"I enjoyed wearing these slip-ons during the summer . They run true to size and are comfy and well-made . However , I ca n't wear them for long walks , as they offer no arch support . Just a nice , pretty shoe for going shopping or going out to eat . I recommend them .","shoe--size, shoe","Positive, Mixed"

LOOOOOOOVE these i can not live without them . I wore them for a playboy costume and they made my butt and legs look perfect ( they are far from perfect ! ) . I never felt so confident in something so revealing . I plan to use these for other costumes and even work too ! Great buy,"buy, these","Positive, Positive"
I like the heel height and the style . I purchased these shoes to take on a trip but they are too big and I will unfortunately be returning them .,"shoes--style, shoes--heel height, shoes","Positive, Positive, Mixed"
"I love these tights . I bought them for everyday wear ( not dancing ) . Not only do they provide more warmth and coverage than pantyhose/nylons in colder temperatures ( when you still want the bare leg look ) , they are also very comfortable and have held up to multiple washes so far . I have washed them in a delicates bag in a normal wash cycle ( along with other clothes ) and then line dried them . I will be purchasing more of these .",tights,Positive
