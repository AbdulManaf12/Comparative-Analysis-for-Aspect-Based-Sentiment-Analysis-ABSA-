Valerie and Jason are wonderful host ! Great place to stay for our trip to Boston ! Location is close to subway for quick trip into the city .,"place--Location, place, place--Jason, place--Valerie","Positive, Positive, Positive, Positive"
"My girlfriend and I stayed in Tiffany 's apartment for twelve nights and it 's been an awesome experience . Tiffany has been nothing but an exceptionally gracious and helpful host with a superhuman response time whenever we needed anything . I had a bit of a chuckle when she apologized for taking a whole 20 minutes to get back to me on a totally non-emergency subject ; just goes to show that she definitely makes great communication a priority ! Checking in was a breeze , and since Tiffany had already provided us with some breakfast staples we were able to just walk in , drop off our bags , and head out to explore Boston . We 'd told Tiffany that we would likely be hosting a friend for a night or two during our stay , and she 'd helpfully set out the air mattress and extra bedding in advance . The place itself is wonderful , managing to cram a lot of space into an apartment with an otherwise pretty low square footage . The loft bedroom was a really nice touch , and the ladder was very easy to climb even when carrying cups of coffee in one hand ( a word of advice for prospective guests : turn on the lights if you need to get up in the middle of the night to use the bathroom . I had a bit of a scare once or twice ! ) . No real reading lights that we could find , unfortunately , so if you want to read in bed and not just watch a couple episodes of Sex and the City before going to sleep like we did , you may want to bring a little night light yourself ! Having a good space to cook in was really important to me when looking for a place to stay , and Tiffany 's kitchen absolutely did n't disappoint . Nice cookware , good knives after a quick honing , and a great stove . We managed to cook up some really nice breakfasts and dinners . The bathroom was pretty standard for a place this size , but it was squeaky clean and nicely decorated ( and featured a suction cup mounted Bluetooth speaker which my girlfriend got a lot of use out of in the mornings ! ) . Shower pressure was n't quite what we 'd expected , but perfectly workable . As others have noted , the apartment can get crazy hot during the winter with no way to control it . The place does contain enough fans and a humidifier to mostly offset the temperature and we were given plenty of advance warning , so while it 's a negative , it 's not a big one . And the location . Oh boy . From the roof deck we had the most beautiful view of the Massachusetts State House and all of the Christmas lights in and around Boston Common ( there are a lot ! ) , and being able to stumble out of bed right down to Park Street Station was extremely nice once we realized that the T is n't as daunting as it looks . Consider this place for the location alone . Two weeks in Boston absolutely was n't enough for me , and when ...","place--bathroom--Shower pressure, place--Tiffany 's kitchen--cookware, place--loft bedroom, place--loft bedroom--reading lights, place--Tiffany--response time, place--Tiffany 's kitchen, place--roof deck--view, place--bathroom, Tiffany--communication, place--location, place, place--Tiffany 's kitchen--stove, place--Checking in, place--Tiffany 's kitchen--knives, place--loft bedroom--ladder, place--Tiffany","Positive, Positive, Positive, Positive, Positive, Positive, Positive, Positive, Positive, Positive, Positive, Positive, Positive, Positive, Positive, Positive"

Penny is a great host ! She was very helpful in guiding us around the city of Boston . The place was clean all the time and very safe and convenient location .

"Let me begin with everything that was great about this place- because there are no doubt notable positives . The location is amazing , the rooftop patio is nice to have , and check-in/communications were great . The two things that made it a little disappointing for me was apartment size/amenities vs the cost , and the sleep situation . It 's hard to know exactly what you are getting from pictures and descriptions , and I 'm sure Tiffany does her best to explain exactly what you are getting to the best of her ability . I am not suggesting for one second that she makes her place out to be something that it is n't . But , for the amount of money we paid per night we could 've stayed in a 5 star hotel , so I was expecting a little more space and nicer upkeep of the bathroom/kitchen etc . Not as far as cleanliness , but broken tiles , cupboards that do n't close and things of that nature . To many people that wo n't matter . So do n't let it deter you if you 're all about location and ease of check in . The part that was the most difficult for me was the sleeping situation . I knew that the bed was in a small loft , and that was fine , but the bed itself was nothing more than a thin mattress and a duvet without a cover . I 'm a bigger guy ( 6 ' 2 ) and my wife and I had a horrible time trying to sleep up there . Perhaps a smaller person would 've done just fine , but I can only talk about my experience . I 've done about 6 airbnb 's and I have found that I walk away from most happy that I did n't book a standard hotel , but if I could go back I would definitely had gotten a hotel for our Boston trip . This place has gotten a ton of great reviews , so I assume my issues are n't commonplace- but regardless I wanted to give an honest review . Tiffany was great and the location was wonderful , but for over $ 300 per night ( CAD ) I was hoping for more .","place--cleanliness, place--cupboards, apartment--amenities, place--tiles, apartment--cost, apartment--size, place--amount of money, place--communications, place--rooftop patio, place, place--location, place--sleeping situation, apartment--sleep situation, place--check-in, place--bed, place--Tiffany","Negative, Negative, Negative, Negative, Negative, Negative, Negative, Positive, Positive, Mixed, Positive, Negative, Negative, Positive, Mixed, Positive"
Penny was such a warm and welcoming host ! My wife and I loved staying in her room that offered privacy and a beautiful view to the backyard and into the city . She was accommodating to our check in and check out times . We had time to chat with her and her son and they are very lovely people .

It was a perfect location for me - just 4 min walk to my conference at the Seaport World Trade Center .

The room is on the small side but it has a bathroom and you can use kitchen in the main area . Good Wi-Fi . Check in and out was very easy .

"Centrally located this place is ideal for 1 person who is only staying a few days as the place does not have much storage space . Be aware that while there is an elevator in the building , you have to carry your suitcase across stairs in the hall prior to reaching the apartment . For those sensitive to noise , not the best choice because of the constant noise from outside ventilation shafts ( windows face a service courtyard ) and service trucks that pop in the middle of the night .

Breakfast and coffee is provided and the hike down the stairs in the morning to use the restroom is n't as horrible as we imagined . The multiple cameras in the home did n't bother us either as they were very apparent and not hidden at all .

"This was our first time using AirBNB , and boy , oh boy , were we impressed with Oine ! Not only was her home SPOTLESS , but she went out of her way to make us feel at home there . She had put out a basket of toys and books for my two-year-old to play with , which we thought was just so lovely . Not only that , but she let us borrow her grandchild 's portable crib ! Oine was available to answer all of our questions , and really made us feel exceptionally comfortable . She even left her parking pass so we would n't have to worry about looking for a parking place on the busy streets of Boston . For our convenience , she also left us a binder with local eateries and their menus ... a great touch !

"We had a group of 6 staying here over the week of July 4th . 2 couples and 2 boys , a teen and a pre-teen . The size of the house was perfect , as both boys had their own room . Everything was clean when we arrived with fresh towels in every room . The bathrooms were well stocked with toilet paper , shampoo and soap . The house is very old and has lots of stairs so keep that in mind . The laundry is in the basement and is coin operated . We did n't mind all the stairs as we wanted to work off all that great Boston food we 'd been eating ! The beds were very comfortable and the A/C worked very well , a good thing since it got really warm out when we were there . We loved the rooftop patio and we watched the fireworks from there and the view was perfect . The other tenants in the building also used the roof patio but everyone was really nice and there was plenty of room . The best part of the house is the location . Beacon Hill is beautiful and very quiet at night so it was nice to come back to that after being out in the busy city all day . Gloria gave us several suggestions on where to go . We followed her suggestion of taking the Boston Harbor Ferry out to Georges Island and exploring Fort Warren . The boys thought that was the greatest ! Be sure to take flashlights if you go . It 's a great adventure ! Our favorite little neighborhood place was Caffe Bella Vita . We loved their sandwiches and their ice cream is very good too . We also loved Boston Commons , a beautiful park right down the street , and the Charles River Esplanade was just a couple blocks away . Gloria was very prompt to respond to any questions we had and she met us at the house when we got there to show us around . If you do n't mind climbing stairs , I would recommend this house .","house--size, house--park, house, house--room--towels, house--roof patio--view, house--A/C, house--roof patio, house--neighborhood, house--location, house--Beacon Hill, house--Gloria, house--beds, house--bathrooms","Positive, Positive, Positive, Positive, Positive, Positive, Positive, Positive, Positive, Positive, Positive, Positive, Positive"

"A gem on Beacon Hill is what we found in many ways . Our family converged in Boston for a medical emergency . We needed a place that would be centrally located in a good area with space to accommodate a large family . We found that and much much more with Gloria and her apartment . First , because of the nature of the medical emergency we did not know when we would be able to take possession of the apartment . When we explained our situation to Gloria , Gloria and her staff offered to be available at whatever time things became stable at the hospital . True to their word , they met us at the apartment at a late hour and were very accommodating . The apartment itself is a lovely , bright apartment with grand areas . Although the apartment is large enough to receive guests it still has a cozy feel to it . Our family came together as a group there during the emergency . The apartment also became the place where our daughter came to after the surgery . Being there in that environment was very positive for her and all of us . The apartment is situated in a perfect place . Within steps you have all of the conveniences that you could want being in the heart of Beacon Hill . The apartment is central to virtually everything in Boston yet provides a quiet haven free from the hustle and bustle a City can bring . Our family plans to return soon to celebrate our blessings .

The Beacon Hill neighborhood is exactly what we were looking for ( my wife and I as well as our two college students ) . We were able to walk to almost any part of Boston ( Boston Harbor , North End , Back Bay , Boston Common or Sourh Boston ) in less than 20 minutes . The appartment is in a vintage brick building ( fits the age and character of Beacon Hill ) . The building has 4 stories and a rooftop . The first two floors are occupied by permanant tenants - nice people . Everyone has access to the rooftop via a common stairway connected at each floor . The third and fourth floors are the rental . All but two of the rooms are air conditioned and all have comfortable beds . There was a full kitchen and two bathrooms . We did n't really use the kitchen , but everything seemed in working order .

"It was Valentine 's weekend and my bf & I decided we wanted to spend it in Boston . We picked Penny 's place because of it 's charm , great reviews , and convenience to the T ( Boston 's transit system ) . Penny was a wonderful host ! We booked our stay during negative 10 degree weather , but Penny made sure we stayed warm by providing us with extra blankets and an additional space heater . She even made me a cup of hot coco to warm up after a full day of walking around in the cold . She also dropped us off at the train a couple times . At first we had a little trouble with the lock to the front entrance of the house , but then we realized we could also access the back which was easier for us . Penny 's home was lovely . The details in her home show her warm personality . The room itself is very cozy with a cute reading nook , an inspiring quote in the bathroom , comfy bed , and the large window with a great view ! For our last stop in Boston we stayed close by checking out the Sam Adams brewery which is a 15 min . walk from Penny 's . We wanted to explore more of the JP neighborhood but unfortunately we did n't have the time . We hope to return during a warmer time to enjoy more .

I could n't have asked for more ! The house is in a quiet neighborhood with easy access both to the airport and the city center . I would definitely stay again !

"What a PERFECT location and lovely home in Boston . My 3 sons and I spent a quick weekend attending my niece 's wedding . We were SO lucky to rent Oine 's space for our stay . Due to the fantastic location , we easily used the T ( plus a short walk ) to get to & from the airport . We were also able to walk to Fenway for a game & walk to the wedding - be careful on cobblestones with heels : ) Oine 's home was wonderful for our family with two bedrooms and 1 . 5 baths . We had plenty of space to gather & plenty of space to retreat . Having the extra half bath really helped when getting ready for the wedding . As it was my sons ' first time in Boston , we all wished we would have been able to stay longer . SO many things within walking distance or the T ( subway ) we would have loved to explore . At least we were able to eat @ Charlie 's Sandwich Shoppe right around the corner ( the Cranberry Griddle Cakes were SO yummy ! ) If & when we 're able to revisit Boston , we 'll most definitely check for availability in Oine 's great home !","Oine 's home--space, Oine 's home--location, Oine 's home","Positive, Positive, Positive"
"Tiffany was an excellent host ! We arrived in Boston at 6 a.m. and did n't get to the apartment until nearly 6:45 a.m. She had blocked out the previous day for us and left us the keys and everything we needed to be able to just come to our temporary home right away and take a much needed nap ! The location was great ! It 's in a super safe and high-end neighborhood , right next to the Boston Commons , State House , and truly just steps away from the Freedom Trail . We loved going up onto the roof deck of the building and taking in the city and watching the sunset glow off of the State House - it was truly beautiful . Compared to the cost of having to book a hotel in the same area , and only getting a room to ourselves , this was a much better option as we truly had our own little home to come back to , store our delicious leftovers in , and do some light cooking , too . We only stayed for four nights , which was perfect for us .","home--roof deck, home--sunset glow off of the State House, home--location, home--Tiffany, home--neighborhood, home","Positive, Positive, Positive, Positive, Positive, Positive"

"We stayed here for 5 nights in early October . The location is absolutely unbeatable . You 're 1 1/2 blocks from the Hynes Convention Center T stop and just a few steps from all sorts of great restaurants , bars , coffee shops and clothing stores . Trader Joe 's and Eataly are just around the corner . The apartment is in a pretty old brownstone with a big bay window overlooking all the action on Newbury Street . We felt like locals coming and going from the building . Parking on and around Newbury is tight , so I 'd advise not bringing a car and just using the T .  The apartment looks just like the listing . The bed in the one bedroom is comfortable enough . There 's also a sofa in the living room that converts to a bed . The kitchen has all the basics you 'd need to cook , although why cook when you 're surrounded by so many great restaurants ? We did buy a bag of ground coffee from Trader Joe 's and made a pot of coffee every morning to save a few dollars . One thing to be aware of is that there 's no elevator in the building , so you 'll have to lug your suitcases up a narrow and fairly steep staircase . So pack light .","apartment--kitchen, apartment--elevator, apartment--bedroom--bed, apartment--Parking, apartment--location, apartment","Positive, Negative, Positive, Negative, Positive, Mixed"

"The apartment is at the ground floor of a larger house and is separated from the main house with a door lockable from within the apartment . It is located just a couple of blocks away from the Bunker Hill monument and is very convenient for working or visiting the naval dock area . There is a large Whole Food store within walking distance : a little pricey , but great for grocery . Because the apartment is on the ground floor and there is a pavement right outside , you will see people walking right outside if you open the blinds . Not a big problem during the week , but there was a little more foot traffic during the weekend . For a similar reason , I used an eye mask to block out more of the street light at night . Although I did not meet her in person , Jennifer was super responsive to queries and problems . I was very impressed that she bought new sheets and an iron . As mentioned in another review , it would have been nice if there were more cooking utensils . Having said that , Jennifer brought down a larger pot when requested . Because I am not used to laundry detergent with a strong fragrance , I had to air the sheets out when I first arrived - this may not be a problem for everyone . Lastly , I am not sure if it was the mattress or the base , but there was some unevenness . Nonetheless , I slept well , it is perhaps just something to attend to in the future .","apartment--Jennifer, apartment--iron, apartment--mattress or the base, apartment--sheets, apartment","Positive, Positive, Negative, Positive, Mixed"

"Cute apartment , amazing building , amazing location . Coffee was provided along with sweeteners and creamer as well as bathroom necessities - a nice touch ! The place was visually clean/tidy , but if there was a professional cleaner in they did not do the floors or the tub ( hairs in the bottom ) . Our air mattress had a slow leak , so it caused the center to sink and made for quite uncomfortable sleeping . Tiffany was nice enough to same day us a new one , but it was a much lower height and a double ( versus the queen ) mattress , so we decided to go with the original air mattress anyhow . Our friends stayed in the loft and said it was quite small but comfy enough . They did have one night where they were woken up by a bug crawling on them ( this could happen anywhere though ) . Also , we tried turning on the TV downstairs and it does n't work as it 's not hooked up to anything so if you want to watch tv it 's only upstairs . No eggs were provided as the listing stated and the bagels that were left were expired and hard . Thought maybe the milk and cereal was left instead , but the milk was expired , too . Lots of little quirks so honestly I do n't think it 's worth it for the price unless you 're in love with the location and want to be there over a hotel . Lastly , do n't ask if she offers discounts because when we did that the price miraculously went up on the listing . I was still able to book 2 of the 3 nights as she had preapproved me at the initial rate , but she would n't respond to my questions as she was presumably hoping to rent to someone at a higher rate . Was given BS reasons of airbnb changing the rate which airbnb clearly states that the rates are driven by the renter . Also , we were trying to book the third night and she rented it to someone else after approving us for it and airbnb said the only way this would happen was if she had approved their rental . Again was given a shady response in regards to this . Just did n't feel too comfortable given these circumstances . Would have rather had the truth up front and could have decided if we wanted to book elsewhere . We stayed our third night at the Westin Copley square for the same exact price and had a much better experience . Would recommend the location and the place if some of the above is corrected , but until then , I 'd take the hotel or a different listing .

"Oine was a terrific host - very responsive by text and email , and thoughtful with her preparation of the apartment , which was spotless and nicely decorated , and feels like home . I thought it was even nicer than the photos . We used the master bed , which was just right . Like another reviewer mentioned , she was thoughtful to leave toys , books , and a pack n play for our 3 year old . She even put out a scooter my daughter loved , and some J & J baby shampoo in the bathroom . The AC is by two window units which worked well . The location ca n't be beat . There 's a playground just a block away , and a nice path for walking between the Back Bay station and Mass Ave . I would highly recommend Oine as a host and her apartment .","apartment--master bed, apartment--Oine, apartment--AC, apartment, apartment--location","Positive, Positive, Positive, Positive, Positive"
"Valerie and Jason set our standards for Airbnb extremely high that makes everywhere else non comparable ! They are extremely hospitable and always willing to chat ! On our very first day , they showed us around and took us up to our room . They let us get situated before offering us to join them for a delicious home cooked lunch . Later that evening when we came back to the house , we fell asleep past the time that we were supposed to go out with a friend for dinner ; Valerie and Jason immediately offered us dinner without hesitation ! Everything that they make is fresh and homemade ( there 's usually a nice treat for you in the morning ) ! I could n't have been more happier anywhere else !

"I had no regrets about my stay at Tiffany 's loft . It 's one of if not the best value in Boston . The location ca n't be beat , the building is nice the apartment is clean has all the basic necessities and the rooftop deck is outstanding . Tiffany is a great host and I had no communication issues with her . A couple of things to keep in mind . The place is small , I would not try to cram 3 people into the apartment . 1 person is great , it was my wife and I and we did n't have any issues but would not call it spacious . She or someone else lives there when it is not being used as an AirBnB , so closets are full and there are personal belongings all over the space . Again not a big deal or even an issue for us but something to be aware of if you need to store clothes/luggage . Also the loft has 3-4 feet of clearance . I am just under 6 feet tall and was crawling up there as I did n't want to risk crouching and hitting my head . It was n't a big deal for me as we only went up there to sleep , but as Tiffany says if you have issues with ladders this is not the place for you . Boston is one of the priciest cities for AirBnBs/Hotels Tiffany 's place is an incredible value assuming you do n't need a lot of space and can handle the loft . It worked for us and we would happily book her place again .","Tiffany 's place--rooftop deck, building, Tiffany 's place--host, Tiffany 's place, Tiffany 's place--location, Tiffany 's place--loft, Tiffany 's place--value","Positive, Positive, Positive, Mixed, Positive, Negative, Positive"

"First , let me start off by saying that the owner of this home messaged me stating that this was one of the busiest weeks of her life and apologized for any inconveniences . That said , when I arrived someone had forgot to flush the toilet and I 'm not talking just pee ( which makes me question if they cleaned anything ) . There was dirty laundry in the hamper ( these two things combined make her cleaning fee an outrageous expense even though it is relatively cheap ) . The bathroom is on par if not worse than most motel bathrooms ( I have stayed in several ) . If you are over six foot you will not fit on the bed or the toilet not even close ( the loft the bed is in is about four feet high so you 're gon na have some trouble moving around ) . Atleast half of the towels have brown/black stains . If none of that bothers you the location is almost unbeatable ( we did not need to take a cab other than to/from the airport ) . And if your into cooking your own food she has just about everything you could ever need ( Just beware of the tap water in the kitchen sink it comes out very cloudy even after letting it run for a little ) . The building itself is very secure and the roof deck is incredible .","building--owner, building, building--kitchen, building--loft--bed, building--hamper--laundry, building--kitchen--tap water, building--towels, building--roof deck, building--location, building--toilet, building--cleaning fee","Negative, Mixed, Mixed, Negative, Negative, Negative, Negative, Positive, Positive, Negative, Negative"

"Bare bones room to stay in while visiting Boston . They offer a private entrance and easily walkable to the transit system . We did n't hang too much in the neighborhood but found it fairly easy to commute from . The Uber ride will run you about 20- to get to Back Bay or Beacon Hill . The room offers a full size bed , refrigerator , kitchen sink and microwave . The Bathroom is quite tiny offering a small standing only shower ( if you 're 200lbs and up , it will be a challenge ) . My husband and I we 're not able to both fit in the bathroom to get ready , so I had to blow dry my hair and do my makeup on the bed with a small mirror . Overall , if you 're looking for a bed and a affordable room , this might be your place . We just wished we would have spent the extra 50- to stay in the center of town with a bigger bed .","room--bathroom--standing, neighborhood, room--bathroom, private entrance","Negative, Positive, Negative, Positive"

"I would start by saying that Helena sought to provide anything I needed during my stay , and I am thankful for that . This was my first AirBnB experience . As a new user , I was unaware that bookings might not include amenities such as use of the kitchen . I understand now that this is a common occurrence . I saw later , after arriving and discussing with Helena , that indeed the use of the kitchen was not included in the amenities . This was an oversight on my part . However , I personally believe that it should have been and could have been made clearer in the written description for the booking . It was not apparent to me that I could not cook in the house and I would not have stayed if I knew that . Something along the lines of `` No use of the stove , yet you can use the microwave to heat food up '' would have been helpful . What did not make much sense to me was that I could use the microwave to cook eggs , which took longer and made more noise than making them all at once on a frying pan , but I could not use the stove even if I cleaned up after myself . Even though this listing is marked as a private room , it is a shared residence with many other tenants . It seemed like I needed to tip-toe around the house as not to disturb anyone . The description in the listing says you need to be very quiet , and this became very apparent right from my arrival . It made me a little uncomfortable when accompanied with not being able to use the kitchen , because I felt as though all the tenants did not want me there . I do not feel like that is an appropriate environment for a stranger to be in , to be honest . I also experienced an odd situation during my stay . I entered the kitchen at 6:30AM one day and there were four dead mice on the kitchen floor . I later thought it may have been the cat bringing them in , but at the time I became even more uncomfortable . On the other hand , I did greatly enjoy the proximity to the Charles River ( specifically since I was staying for the Head of the Charles rowing regatta , the Northeastern University Boathouse ) . The cost was relatively expensive ( as a student ) , but I suppose reasonable when compared to hotels in the area on such short notice .","private room, Helena, cost, booking--description, house","Negative, Positive, Negative, Negative, Negative"

"The Airbnb was good overall , and Valerie and Jason are amazing people . I was aware from the description that the room would be on the third floor and the bathroom would be on the first , but it was difficult for me . I have bad feet which did make it difficult ; however , that is a more personal choice . I just wanted to add that in case others have feet issues . The bathroom being downstairs was also somewhat difficult . Even though I knew it would be downstairs , I did expect it to be a bit more private . The bathroom is right in the kitchen area , which did make it difficult , at least for me , if I wanted to shower at certian times . Such as , the hosts did have friends over one night in the kitchen , which made me feel uncomfortable taking a shower as we would have to do so about two feet from the party . Overall , I think the location , the room , and the stay itself was good , I just personally found the bathroom privacy a bit uncomfortable .","Airbnb--room, Airbnb--bathroom, Airbnb--Valerie and Jason, Airbnb--bathroom--privacy, Airbnb--location, Airbnb","Positive, Negative, Positive, Negative, Positive, Mixed"

"The best thing about staying in this Airbnb hosted by Kama was the privacy . I make numerous trips to Boston and staying in the apartment felt like it was my personal home base . Kama ensured the key was accessible since she was n't able to meet me due to snowy weather . That said , it may not be the best unit for first time travelers to Boston . While Kama was reachable , the response time was generally 2-12+ hours ... ok for me , but might not be ideal for someone wanting more personal attention or local travel advice . The oven door was broken while we were there and it made cooking in the unit much more challenging . We also were n't able to get the tv functional with good reception , but did n't ask for assistance so it may have attributed to user error . : ) Overall , very clean and nice one bedroom unit . Good privacy and secure building . Very convenient ( within one mile ) to the Green B , C and D lines . Whole Foods within easy walking distance - wonderful ! Great to have the whole unit to ourselves . Definitely will look to book again on future trips to Boston !","Kama, building","Negative, Positive"

"We felt confident from the photos and the reviews that we would have an enjoyable stay with Penny and her son Dakota and we were not disappointed by either the room and its en suite or by the general atmosphere of their home and hospitality . Penny has plenty of great information about the locality to share for those who want it , and we had a good chats without feeling pressure to do so . We wanted some quiet time to reflect and found the room , with its great view of trees , homes and a church , a great place to do that . From previous experience of Boston my wife and I were very familiar with Jamaica Plain , but were pleasantly surprised to find Penny 's home was in a quite special area of JP we did n't know about ... a little sanctuary nestled away from the hustle and bustle yet just a couple of minutes walk from Center Street 's restaurant 's , cafes , shops and buses . All the technicalities were really well handled from pre-communications to food available for breakfast and snacks .

One small thing to note for future guests is that the front stairs ( the outdoor ones in the pictures ) are very very steep . I was here with my 65ish-year-old parents , and while they ended up being totally fine , I was nervous every time they walked up or down the stairs . ( That said , they have pretty high standards so the fact that they were comfortable in the apartment says a lot about how nice its amenities are ! ) Not even really a drawback to the stay , just something you may want to consider if you have older and/or slightly infirm guests in your group .

"Todd was een uitstekend gastheer . Onzichtbaar en toch aanwezig . Hij nam de dag dat ik zou aankomen per email contact met me op om me welkom te heten en instructies achter te laten . Dat werkte uitstekend omdat ik niet de exacte tijd van mijn aankomst wist . De kamer was uitstekend , schoon en rustig . Precies wat ik nodig had .","De kamer, Todd","Positive, Positive"
Tiffany 's place was perfect in all ways ! The location was perfect and the Park Station T stop was right next to the place so that was awesome . Everything was pretty much in walking distance and there were restaurants and bars right next door ! The rooftop was also a unique touch so I would definitely recommend ! Tiffany was super responsive about any questions and there were guidebooks and suggestions on the table in the kitchen ! The check-in and check-out process was super simple and we will definitely be returning !,"Tiffany 's place--Tiffany, Tiffany 's place--check-out, Tiffany 's place, Tiffany 's place--location, Tiffany 's place--check-in, Tiffany 's place--rooftop","Positive, Positive, Positive, Positive, Positive, Positive"
"Valerie and Jason are very nice , with the help of their map , I can easily explore ( Website hidden by Airbnb ) talking with Jason , I have more understanding of this country .

I will come back to Boston and definitely choose Valerie 's house again !","house--view, house--room, house, house--Valerie and Jason","Positive, Positive, Positive, Positive"

"My stay at Jen 's place was great ! It really is in the heart of Charlestown , just a few short blocks from the Bunker Hill Monument . Jen was very fast to respond to all of my communications and I really appreciated the flexibility with check-in and check-out . The only note I would make is that the bathroom is accessed through the bedroom , which may not be ideal for two couples .","Jen 's place, Jen 's place--Jen, Jen 's place--bedroom, Jen 's place--check-out, Jen 's place--check-in","Mixed, Positive, Negative, Positive, Positive"
"My husband and I had a great stay in the second floor unit . The building is full of original character but also has the conveniences of a modern home . It is located a short walk from the train which will take you right to downtown in 10-15 min . The neighbourhood is also full of character . Although we were not out too late at night we felt very safe walking back from the train . Parking is very limited in the neighbourhood so this is something to keep in mind if you do have car . There is a grocery store a 15 min walk away , which was easy to walk from with a few groceries for breakfasts and snacks . Terry was easy to get a hold of and directions for getting to and into the apartment were very clear . Overall a great alternative to the high priced hotels of downtown .","building--Parking, building--neighbourhood, building, building--Terry, building--directions","Positive, Positive, Positive, Positive, Positive"

"I enjoyed staying at Todd 's place . I was in bedroom # 1 . The street is quiet and residential . The instructions were clear to get into the home . It is a bit like a coach house but attached to the home . The room was very nice , large and clean with lots of light and an AC unit . There was a mini fridge stocked with waters , a keurig and microwave near the entrance of the place . I did not realize that I would be sharing a bathroom with other guests from the other bedrooms , so that was a bit of a surprise but it was clean and some toiletries were provided . I did not meet the host but would recommend this place to others .","place--instructions, place--bathroom, place--room, place, place--street","Positive, Mixed, Positive, Mixed, Positive"

"Valerie and Jason were very generous gracious hosts . The apartment is exactly as pictured and described . The only caveat for guests to be mindful of is having to walk down 3 flight of stairs to use the bathroom which is in the kitchen . So , if Valerie and Jason are having dinner you may not want to take a shower especially because Jason is such a good cook you 'd get pulled into wanting to eat his delicious food ( I know I did ! ) . Valerie 's baked goods are also amazing ! I 'd definitely stay here again if I ever get the chance to make it to Boston again !","apartment--Valerie 's baked goods, apartment--Jason, apartment--Valerie","Positive, Positive, Positive"

"The place was one of the nicest apartments I 've ever seen ( apartment does n't seem quite accurate , given the sheer size of the unit , but I ca n't think of the appropriate word ) . It had serious historic charm and some great modern design features as well . Gloria was a pleasure to work with , and was gracious and helpful throughout our stay .

"Gloria 's home was fantastic and we 100 % recommend it to all future Airbnb users ! A group of 5 of us stayed in the home for the labor day weekend and it worked out perfectly . Gloria met us at the house and showed us around our beautiful and spacious weekend home . The rooms were clean , towels were folded and ready for use and the rooftop was even better than in the pictures . One last note , the location of the home is perfect , as we spent our time walking around the city ( through the parks , along the water , and shopping in the boutiques that line the streets ) . Thanks , Gloria for making our stay so enjoyable !","home--rooftop, Gloria--Gloria, Gloria--rooftop, Gloria--rooms, home--location, home--rooms, home, home--Gloria","Positive, Positive, Positive, Positive, Positive, Positive, Positive, Positive"
"This cozy property is perfect for 2 young adults who do n't mind walking several blocks for public transportation ( since no parking is provided by host for this location ) . Queen bed is actually in the living room , as there is no separate bedroom . Space only has 1 small window unit that is undersized for the property ( NOTE : host did provide fan upon request to move cool air from kitchen to living area ) . Potential noise from upstairs unit may require you to relocate to another property during your stay . Kitchen is compact , but is updated & well equipped .","property--Kitchen, property--parking, property--upstairs, property--window, property, property--bedroom","Positive, Negative, Positive, Negative, Mixed, Negative"

"Valerie and Jason were very nice and welcoming . They waited for us to let us in and show us the appartment although we arrived quite late . The room is absolutely perfect with a VERY comfortable bed and also the kitchen and the bathroom could not have been cleaner or better . Jason gave us a map of Boston and showed us a all interesting places to go , due to that we nearly saw everything interesting about Boston within the two days we had been there : ) On the last evening we played Yahtzee all together and we had a really funny last evening . We would definitely stay here again and can just recommend this place , as it is also pretty near to the centre of Boston - 3 $ by uber !

"This place was extraordinary ! Gleaming hardwood floors , 25 foot ceilings -- I felt like I was in a historic mansion .

Huge shower with great water pressure . Wifi , fluffy towels , and fireplaces throughout the rooms . The rooms had all the charm of Beacon Hill without being cluttered . The kitchen had everything we needed . Spacious , comfortable and clean - a terrific value ! With the rooftop deck and location , there is nothing better in Boston ! Gloria was a fantastic host , accommodating me , my mom , and my cousin at the last minute . We ca n't wait to come back and stay here for a girls weekend -- much cheaper than 2 hotel rooms or a nice suite , GIGANTIC and luxurious space , absolutely relaxing , beautiful and very fun place to stay !

"Terry 's place is in a wonderful building and is decorated ( and stocked ) for a comfortable stay for active people . The neighborhood has interesting architecture and diverse residents . The walk to Roxbury MTBA Station is just a few minutes . The area is short on stores and places to eat , but those can be reached by foot , bus , subway or Uber . We returned from Fenway about midnight ( on foot ) and the area was well-lit and quiet . Three things were a challenge to us ( 60-somethings ) -- getting in/out of the clawfoot tub shower without a safety bar , a great bed with one side pushed against the wall , and a coffee pot ready to go - but no coffee .","Terry 's place--clawfoot tub shower--safety bar, Terry 's place--neighborhood--architecture, Terry 's place--area, Terry 's place--neighborhood--residents, Terry 's place--bed, Terry 's place, Terry 's place--coffee pot--coffee, Terry 's place--building","Negative, Positive, Positive, Positive, Mixed, Mixed, Negative, Positive"
