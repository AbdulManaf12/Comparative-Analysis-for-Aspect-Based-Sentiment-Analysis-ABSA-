My husband and I we 're not able to both fit in the bathroom to get ready , so I had to blow dry my hair and do my makeup on the bed with a small mirror .

However , we had a scoutmob and thought we\\ 'd try the charming-looking restaurant just walking distance from our apartment . We waited at the front of the restaurant for several minutes before a server finally ushered us to the bar in the back . The owner then shuffled us to a corner of the bar and said the wait was 5-10 minutes . '' We waited for an hour . I don\\'t mind waiting , I just need to be given an appropriate estimate . we really didn\\'t have an hour to wait that night , and would have come back a different evening instead . Once we were finally seated , the owner dropped by our table several times and delivered our food personally . While this was a nice touch , he seemed more concerned with this over-the-top type of service then on swift and efficient service . I don\\'t need a napkin personally dropped in my lap for me , I just want you to bring me what I ordered in a reasonable amount of time . ( fyi- we never received the wine we ordered , though they did try to charge us for it ) . The food itself was delicious . Still it took forever to get our bill and when we finally did , it was wrong . They were good about fixing this , but returned the check with 18  gratuity ( of the original total bill -- including drinks we never got ) included.. We weren\\'t about to stiff them , but it also seems unfair to add such an outrageous tip to a small table -- especially when their service was so very poor . Service : overly-attentive , inefficient , slow . Food : delicious ( awesome gnocchi ) . Bill : believe what it says here . Whether they are deceitful or just plain sloppy , its questionable . they\\ 'd get just one star if it weren\\'t that the gnocchi was so yummy .\n",
