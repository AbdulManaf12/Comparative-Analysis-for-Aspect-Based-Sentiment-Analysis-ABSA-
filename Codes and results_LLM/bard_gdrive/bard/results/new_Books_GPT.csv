"Cathy Glass is very famous in the UK and is becoming so in the USA . She is , as they say in England , a Foster carer ; one who provides foster care to neglected or abused children . Damaged is a book that outlines the year in which Cathy Glass and her three children , against all odds , took care of an eight year old girl who had been sexually abused beyond anyone\ 's wildest imagination . The book is a quest as to whether this girl could be saved or not . We get an important look at the British Child Protection services which , though filled with problems , is substantially better than the United States\ ' . A study by National Child Abuse and Neglect Data System ( NCANDS ) states that one out of five children is abused emotionally , physically , or sexually by the time he or she reaches age 18 . One . Out . Of . Five . Stop for a moment . Put this down and think about that . If it\ 's a statistic that you read and it passed over you quickly like sink water , then we need for you to frame it within a context that you can understand . Place your right hand on the table and then count the digits . Most of you will count five . Now cut one of the digits off . Your choice . Choose whichever one you like , because the loss of this digit should be random . Just like a child . Picture a work week . Five days , for most of you . Select any one of those days . Tuesday ? That\ 's random enough . Now imagine that every single Tuesday you must endure torture . You will be denied food and perhaps you will be forced to wear filthy clothing . You will be assaulted randomly and you won\'t know when each attack is coming or from whom . You may well be forced to lean over a desk or a sink while someone sodomizes you . You may be forced to felate a stranger despite the fact that your gag reflex is causing you to vomit . Despite the fact that your nostrils ; your mouth are filling up with your own bile and stomach contents you will have to continue . If not , you will be beaten , perhaps cut . Or burn . As we write these important facts about Ms Glass\ 's book , we are wondering how much Amazon VINE will not allow us to print , deciding that it is too vulgar . It\ 's not too vulgar to publish in a book ; it\ 's not too vulgar to occur to a child , but to review it ? We shall see . But this is only on Tuesday . On Wednesday you can go back to your life of regular day to day existence , when you know what to expect ; the cards you will be dealt are rational , even if they are difficult . You may at least expect that you will have some kind of control and that the ways in which you are treated are rational ; have some form of continuance to them . After all , it is only one out of five . Enjoy the other four work days . They are safe . Or this : You yourself are the parent of five children . Select one of them . Any one , it doesn\'t matter . This child will be tortured , violated , starved , degraded and then taught to believe that he or she deserves it . Go ahead . Select one of your children . If you don\'t do it , the nature of statistics will do it for you . Even if you are a parent of two or three : the fact remains that one out of five children are abused . This is an international emergency . There is no other crime statistic or emergency situation that tops this in terms of frequency or in terms of importance . Yet our culture continues to ignore it . DSS is so poorly underfunded and over worked that they the average case worker has more files on his or her desk than there are work weeks in a year . Not one of these workers will admit to it , but they could all tell you that they\ 're seriously overworked ; their desks loaded with files . What they do is triage . Many of the American ones are interns . They are tired and frustrated and they often take the blame for something that isn\'t their fault . Many of them are undergraduate students over their heads thinking they were coming here for observation hours . Schoolteachers are required by law to report any child whom they suspect has been abused . But how do you report a child who has not come to you directly or appeared with bruises ? And if there\ 's a child who is too terrified to admit that they\ 've been abused , once DSS gets involved the child will swear up and down that they\ 're being cared for at home . DSS shakes its head , leaves the residence and the child is beaten or punished severely for having spilled the secret . Frankly , even though a mandated reporter may be sure , Social Services find the reports to be an irritation . International emergency . There are a number of ways in which to work on this problem . The first of which is that we , as parents and citizens need to be aware that one out of five children are abused . Perhaps even our own . We mustn\'t rule out the possibility that one of our children is being abused and we do not see it . Or that we choose not to see it ? The second is that we must stretch the already over worked staff at DSS . The more we dump on them the more likely they are to become vocal in the fact that they\ 're so dreadfully overworked and understaffed . Yes , their voices have been ignored so far , but isn\'t this what causes us to give up in defeat ? Certainly this is the case with abused . And we have voices as well . And Representatives . Children . It may well be true for those who help them as well . And we must write our Senators and Representatives and let them know that more money must be put into Social Services . If we put the same amount of money into caring for our children as we put into national defense think for a moment how things might be different . Think again . Do we defend our borders with more vigilance than we defend our own children ? Why do we have people who protest in front of abortion clinics but who will not stand in front of Social Services demanding that more money be spent on saving and protecting our living children ? Why did President George W. Bush decide to return billions of dollars to the taxpayers of this country while there are children who are starving and succumbing to the vilest acts of terrorism imaginable ? Why does this same president dare to speak about family values ? What is a war on terrorism other than an oxy-moron . Our children require safety , not oil . Awareness . That\ 's the number one step . You must become aware . Power . That\ 's step number two . Do not underestimate the power that you , as a single individual , have over this situation . As you stand on your soccer fields and at your bus stops , discuss this issue instead of the color of your new sofa or the latest discussion of move along day and what teacher your child will have next year . As you look at that little girl who cries at the bus stop each morning or the little boy who arrives late , if at all , to soccer practice without water or a ball and deep down inside you know something\ 's wrong , don\'t shake your head and then go to work . How about that fifteen year old girl who is always dressed in black and is considered bizarre because she has multiple piercings and cuts herself ? She talks to no one , so no one talks to her . Do something about it . You can begin by reading this book . One out of five , folks . One out of five .",book--Ms Glass,Positive,"Cathy Glass, UK, USA, Foster carer, neglected or abused children, Damaged (book), year, eight year old girl, sexually abused, British Child Protection services, United States, National Child Abuse and Neglect Data System (NCANDS), child abuse, child protection services, DSS, case worker, interns, undergraduate students, schoolteachers, Social Services, parents, citizens, Senators, Representatives, money, national defense, abortion clinics, President George W.

"As a voracious reader of many genres who experiences books in a visceral manner , and as a woman who was physically incapable of bearing children , I knew this story would be painful and tried to avoid it . As numerous reviewers reported , I read it within a 24 hour period , turning the last page moments ago . It is astonishing that despite approaching age 60 I am nevertheless shocked to my emotional core , , particularly because Glass admirably writes in a nearly clinical fashion , presumably to permit the revolting facts to speak for themselves . To add any adjectives as plumage would possibly be misconstrued as pandering to the prurient . I applaud the writer\ 's rare gift to be at once both depressing and uplifting , exhausting and energetic , tedious and global . To wit , she has taken material which might have been a ruthless indictment of British social services and injected sufficient humanity ( doubtless derived from her personal experience as a lifelong caregiver ) and painted a picture which despite pervasive ugliness resonates with hope . As such , this book is a triumph demanding to be read b all who aspire to call themselves citizens of the universe .","book--writer, book--story, book","Positive, Mixed, Mixed","reader, genres, books, story, reviewers, age, emotional core, facts, adjectives, writer, gift, material, British social services, humanity, picture, ugliness, hope, book","Positive, Positive, Positive, Negative, Positive, Positive, Negative, Negative, Positive, Positive, Positive, Negative, Positive, Positive, Positive, Positive, Positive, Positive, Positive, Positive"

I recommend this , or any other book by this author , especially if you are considering becoming a foster parent or a social worker .","book--Cathy Glass, book","Positive, Positive","Cathy Glass, person, writer, book, chapter, reader, tears, chuckle, caregivers, parents, social services, true story, England, United States, foster parent, social worker","Positive, Positive, Positive, Positive, Positive, Positive, Positive, Positive, Positive, Positive, Negative, Positive, Positive, Positive, Positive, Positive, Positive"

"Cathy Glass is a foster mother with a lot of experience taking care of hurt and neglected children . When she consents to take Jodie into her care she is shaken by how deeply troubled she is . Jodie 's tantrums range from cursing and kicking to multiple personalities , the level of abuse she experienced is beyond what most people can imagine . This book can be hard to read at times but Cathy 's strength and her dedication to helping this child is impressive , it held a lot of good ideas and lessons about taking care of children in pain . Reading about the patience and determination that Cathy shows in caring for this little girl is inspiring , although her no holds barred story shows the tremendous hoops many foster parents have to jump through in order to get the support and help they need for the children in their care .

"There really should be a way to give something negative stars . Short review : If you know or care about good writing , avoid this book , because it will make you shudder and cringe all the way through . The only thing I can recall that was more badly written is Twilight . Long version : It is not often that a book manages to irritate me repeatedly within the first two pages , so I suppose a book that does could be considered extraordinary . By that criterion , The Burnt House by Faye Kellerman is extraordinary . The irritation begins in the first paragraph with a missing antecedent . Sixty-seven seconds later , with its nose still headed skyward , it inexplicably yawed to the left . . . . To what does it refer ? The preceding sentence has three subjects : the skies , the wind , and the heavens\ ' visibility , none of which is likely to yaw to the left while its nose is headed skyward . We are left to assume that it must refer to the plane . Later in the same sentence , Kellerman states that after clipping a power line , the plane thundered its last hurrah . A last hurrah is a final performance or appearance at the end of a career , a triumphant farewell . A crashing plane is hardly making a triumphant farewell ; it is simply . . . crashing . The only thing worse than using a clich is using the wrong clich . So much for the first paragraph . Yes , I said first paragraph . In the next paragraph , Kellerman states that the plane\ 's fuselage landed on an apartment house , and later , in the same sentence , refers to the building as a residential structure . I suppose just saying the building would have been too simple ? Farther down , Kellerman says , The stench of fire , smoke , and fuel oil that infused the air was toxic and suffocating . There are three things wrong with this sentence . First , where did the fuel oil come from and what is it doing there ? There is no mention of oil furnaces or other oil-burning equipment . Second , there are many stenches that smell bad enough to be toxic , but a stench , by itself , is not toxic . Finally , there\ 's infused . Infuse generally refers to a liquid . It would have been better simply to say , filled the air . A sentence or two later , Kellerman says , Oxygen was choked out of the atmosphere , which conjures up a picture of a pair of giant hands grabbing the air by the throat and strangling it . Kellerman finishes off her prologue thus : Within a heartbeat of time , a green suburban landscape had been transformed into an unimaginable holocaust of hell . Now , as far a I know , a heartbeat usually is used as a measure of time . I do not recall ever seeing it used as a measurement of anything else -- say , a heartbeat of bourbon or a heartbeat of anxiety or a heartbeat of Tabasco sauce . As for unimaginable holocaust of hell , that\ 's so bad it\ 's almost good . To call the scene unimaginable after spending two paragraphs not only imagining it , but describing it , is absurd . Since holocaust refers to something completely destroyed by fire , and hell burns forever without being destroyed , a holocaust of hell is an impossibility . Thirty-seven hours after the crash , Kellerman says , the fire was still far from out and Jet fuel was still stoking the flames . Kellerman , it appears , does not realize that jet fuel burns QUICKLY , which is precisely why it\ 's used in jets . The only way there could still be jet fuel around thirty-seven hours after the crash is if additional jet fuel were being dumped on or pumped into the area . Kellerman\ 's dialogue is just as bad as her narrative . Peter Decker tells his wife that he would love to see her parents . Surprised , she says , You would ? He replies , After witnessing such harrowing events , I look forward to a night with the in-laws and their mundane problems . Besides , your mother is a phenomenal cook . Nobody talks like that -- NOBODY . I\ 'll spare you further examples . Suffice it to say that Kellerman has never actually heard real people talking -- or if she did , she didn\'t pay much attention . Kellerman also takes time out to give us blow-by-blow accounts of events and conversations that have nothing to do with the story . In one such irksome interlude , Kellerman recounts the conversation between Marge ( one of the detectives ) and her adopted daughter Vega , who is all in a dither because she has been invited to a party . Vega , we are told , was raised in a strict religious cult and is socially blunted . For nearly four pages , we are treated to Marge\ 's motherly advice ; for instance : Sweetheart , just be your own sweet self . Talk about the weather , talk about politics , talk about your work . Well , now , THAT is guaranteed to make the girl the life of the party , isn\'t it ? What does this have to do with the story ? Nothing . Why is it there ? I have no idea . It takes up nearly four pages that should either have been omitted or used to move the story along . Curiously , Kellerman refers to women by their first names and men by their last names . Thus , Marge Dunn is Marge , but her fellow detective , Scott Oliver , is not Scott but Oliver . Likewise , Rina Decker is Rina , but her husband Peter is Decker . What is the purpose of this sexist nomenclature ? And it IS sexist , since it is done arbitrarily by sex : men get the last name , women get the first name . Like her husband Jonathan , Kellerman has the annoying habit of describing people\ 's clothing , even when it is utterly irrelevant , which is most of the time . Worse , she tries to be clever about it . After describing a woman\ 's other clothing , Kellerman says , Her hair was pinned back into a ponytail and her feet were housed in flip-flops . Aside from the passive voice , which is always annoying , that word housed is irksome . Shoes are not houses , and the word is especially absurd used in connection with flip-flops . Apparently Kellerman thinks that describing feet as housed in this or that kind of footwear is terribly clever , because she does it several more times throughout the book . What about the story itself ? I suppose there is one , but when a book is so badly written that I can\'t read a single page without running into several literary blunders , I cease to care about the story .","book--accounts, book--narrative, \ 's dialogue, book--interlude, book--first paragraph, book--passive voice, book--sentence, book, book--word, book--Kellerman","Negative, Negative, Negative, Negative, Negative, Negative, Negative, Negative, Negative, Negative","book--writing, book--story, book--narrative, book--dialogue, book--events, book--conversations, book--clothing","Negative, Negative, Negative, Negative, Negative, Negative, Negative, Negative, Negative, Negative, Negative, Negative, Negative, Negative, Negative, Negative, Negative, Negative, Negative, Negative, Negative, Negative, Negative, Negative, Negative, Negative, Negative, Negative, Negative, Negative, Negative, Negative, Negative, Negative, Negative, Negative, Negative, Negative, Negative, Negative, Negative, Negative, Negative, Negative, Negative, Negative, Negative, Negative, Negative, Negative, Negative, Negative, Negative, Negative, Negative, Negative, Negative, Negative, Negative, Negative, Negative, Negative, Negative, Negative, Negative, Negative, Negative, Negative, Negative, Negative, Negative, Negative, Negative, Negative, Negative, Negative, Negative, Negative, Negative, Negative, Negative"

"I really enjoyed Kellerman\ 's \'The Burnt House\ ' . It satisfied my immediate need for a mixture of fantasy and thrills . With Kellerman ( Faye ) , I don\'t go looking for solid reality , because I am in a mood for escape from reality and enjoy entering her world of suspense . When I actually get time to sit down and read ( Kids , grandkids , Job ) , Kellerman grabs my attention with ease and transports me quickly into Rina and Peter\ 's adventures . When I am lying in bed reading her on my Kindle , I thoroughly enjoy that judgmental ( bitchy ) part of myself that critically assesses the twists and turns of her plots ( How likely is THAT to happen ? ) and then immediately am swept back into the read .

"This is the first Peter Decker/Rina Lazarus book that I 've read . According to the other reviews this is not the best in the series and I can see why . The bizarre coincidence that links the crimes is never questioned by the investigators . In some of the investigating there is too much detail , in other parts there 's not enough . Some things are not explained at all such as when and how the unexpected body got into the building . These 2 stories could have been separate books , there is no reason to link them which turns out to be an artificial device and stretches the readers ability to suspend disbelief .","Peter Decker/Rina Lazarus book--detail, Peter Decker/Rina Lazarus book--parts, Peter Decker/Rina Lazarus book--2 stories","Negative, Negative, Negative","Peter Decker/Rina Lazarus book, series, coincidence, investigators, investigating, detail, parts, unexpected body, building, stories, artificial device, readers ability, suspension of disbelief","Mixed, Negative, Negative, Negative, Mixed, Mixed, Negative, Negative, Negative, Negative, Negative, Negative"

"We\ 've read the entire set of Decker/Lazarus novels , and generally enjoy Faye Kellerman\ 's not-too-gruesome detective stories , with plenty of family time to add to their charm . Sometimes she goes overboard with her expositions of conservative Judaism ( beliefs and practices ) , but thankfully those references are pretty casual in Burnt House . Meanwhile , a clever two-pronged plot centers our attention in this tale . When an airplane crash in Decker\ 's police turf kills all aboard , and a jerky husband claims his wife was aboard , despite no proof of that , finding out what indeed did happen to her preoccupies most of the pages . But later on , a body is discovered in the underground of the house the plane crashed into ; yet the corpse is eventually ruled as not the missing wife . Thus two unsolved mysteries baffle Decker and his regular work pals Scott and Marge . Pretty soon it turns out the wife had an affair with a San Jose married man named Raymond Holmes , who becomes a prominent suspect . Before it\ 's over , the detectives traipse all over California and New Mexico searching for the truth , So a decent tale , with a pretty clever plot and a surprising enough dnouement awaits . Our problem is that in between setting the stage and then tying everything up with ribbons at the end , we experienced a serious case of boredom . We think the plot progressed too slowly and did so little to sustain suspense , that we were just tired of the whole thing by the time everything got resolved . When we care more about getting on to our next book then finding out whodunit , that\ 's a good sign something was wrong . In our judgment Burnt House needed better editing and way fewer pages - an Agatha Christie it\ 's not ! !","Burnt House--suspense, Burnt House, Burnt House--pages, Burnt House--whole thing, Burnt House--editing, Faye Kellerman, Burnt House--stories, Burnt House--tale, Burnt House--plot, Burnt House--dnouement","Negative, Mixed, Negative, Negative, Negative, Positive, Positive, Positive, Mixed, Positive","Decker/Lazarus novels, Faye Kellerman, detective stories, family time, conservative Judaism, Burnt House, airplane crash, jerky husband, missing wife, body, underground of the house, unsolved mysteries, Decker,","Positive, Positive, Positive, Positive, Negative, Positive, Negative, Negative, Negative, Negative, Negative, Negative, Negative, Negative, Negative, Negative, Negative, Negative, Negative, Negative, Negative, Negative, Negative, Negative, Negative, Negative, Negative, Negative, Negative, Negative, Negative, Negative, Negative, Negative, Negative, Negative, Negative, Negative, Negative, Negative, Negative, Negative, Negative, Negative, Negative, Negative, Negative, Negative, Negative, Negative, Negative, Negative,"

"A West Air commuter jet takes off from Burbank Airport bound for San Jose , California . The plane was climbing to cruising altitude when suddenly it yawed to port and reversed its climb . The plane dove back to earth and crashed with deadly force and exploded into an eighteen-unit apartment building . The crash site was located in the community of Granada Hills some twenty miles northwest of Los Angeles . Fire , police and rescue teams rushed to the scene to find no survivors . Once the fire was out and the body count did n't add up the Los Angeles Police Department , West Valley Division led by Detective Lieutenant Decker began the search for flight attendant Roseanne Dresden . The search for Roseanne turns into a possible murder investigation . Kellerman sets up a twisted plot by throwing in an extra body of an unidentified murder victim into the crash scene . As it turned out that murder occurred thirty years before the crash . The book is well written but at times the storyline is implausible and the pace is tedious . There were far too many conversations full of small talk that did n't advance the plot . Long-winded interrogations added to the slow pace and officers repeating information from those scenes to associates did n't help . That being said I read on to the bitter end . Better for speed-readers .

"Although I 'm sure I 'm incorrect in most of the details , I sometimes picture the writing careers of Jonathan and Faye Kellerman as being sort of like A Star is Born . Jonathan was the first to be an established writer , and soon , Faye would follow . For a while , he was the star , but now -- despite his continued bestselling numbers -- his quality has faded considerably , and Faye is now clearly the better of the two . Within the past month or so , I 've read one book from each of them . Jonathan Kellerman 's Compulsion was another dud , and Faye Kellerman 's The Burnt House is another good work . The title residence is actually an apartment building in which a commuter plan has crashed into shortly after its takeoff from Burbank heading towards San Jose . The accident has occurred very close to the Granada Hills home of Peter and Rina Decker , and even closer to the school of their daughter Hannah . Fortunately , all are fine , but Peter , a police lieutenant who oversees homicide investigations , finds that there is still much to be done after the fires have been put out . In particular , Roseanne Dresden , though listed as one of the crash victims , is alleged by her step-father to have never been on the flight . She has disappeared , however , and the step-father suspects her philandering husband . Decker and his detectives try to determine if she was on the flight , but the airline refuses to disclose any information and there are no remains found at the crash site that belong to her . A body is found , but it is not Rosanne ; instead , it is a much older corpse apparently stashed in the apartment building decades ago and exposed after the crash . This leads to a second mystery , in trying to determine who the victim is and who killed her . Sadly , the resolution of this second plot will hinge on an incredible coincidence that Kellerman does n't really even try to justify . This coincidence hurts The Burnt House , but not irreparably ; overall , this remains a good book . Why does Faye Kellerman continue to succeed while her husband slides downhill ? As much as anything , it has to do with characters : Faye has created a world with a bunch of well-defined characters who have grown over time ( in fact , my one continued gripe with the series is that is marketed as a Peter Decker/Rina Lazarus mystery , when Rina has not used that last name in over a decade of fictional or real time ) . It 's been a little while since Kellerman has written a book in the series , but for her fans , it is worth that wait .","Burnt House--plot, Burnt House, Compulsion, Burnt House--Faye Kellerman, Compulsion--Jonathan Kellerman, book","Negative, Mixed, Mixed, Positive, Mixed, Positive","Jonathan Kellerman, Faye Kellerman, writing careers, quality, book, Compulsion, The Burnt House, title residence, apartment building, crash, Peter Decker, Rina Decker, Hannah, Roseanne Dresden, step-father, philandering husband, detectives, airline, information, remains, body, older corpse, second mystery, victim, incredible coincidence, characters, world, Peter Decker/Rina Lazarus mystery, series, wait","Negative, Positive, Positive, Negative, Negative, Negative, Positive, Positive, Positive, Positive, Positive, Negative, Negative, Negative, Negative, Negative, Positive, Positive, Negative, Negative, Positive, Positive, Positive, Positive, Positive"

"This suspenseful , entertaining mystery begins as a commuter plane crashes into an apartment house in California 's West San Fernando Valley , not far from the Deckers ' house , and bursts into flames . The LAPD 's Lieutenant Peter Decker is called to the scene . The crash , later found to be caused by a mechanical failure , presents Decker with a baffling mystery : There is no sign of a flight attendant who had reportedly been on the plane and perished in the crash , but in the ruins of the building , searchers find the body of an unidentified young woman , apparently killed by a blow to the head about 30 years ago . I really liked this book , with its combination of fast-paced police procedural , interesting characters , and portrayals of different cultures . As usual , we get glimpses of the Orthodox Jewish family life of Rina and Peter and family , plus in this installment we are also taken to Santa Fe , where we get to meet a traditional native family of that distinctive culture . If you like to read about delicious food , these two families give us plenty of it !

"Shortly after 8 a.m. a commuter plane takes off from Burbank airport . It will never reach cruising altitude . Instead it will crash into an apartment building , incinerate it , and both cover up and uncover two murders-one that happened that day , and one that happened over twenty years earlier . Pete Decker is an LAPD Detective Lieutenant . It will be up to him and his team to figure out who died , and when . And as things progress Decker has more suspects , not less . Roseanne Dresden , a WestAir flight attendant went missing the same time as the plane crash and her stepfather is convinced that her husband is to blame for her death and that her body will be found in the ashes . He 's equally convinced that the police do n't care and the only way to get action is to stay in Decker 's face . Then there 's Dresden 's mysterious paramour . Her husband constantly played around , so why should n't she ? She had broken off the affair-or had she ? Mix that in with a twenty-year-old , defunct pot-smoking , free-love church group that lived commune-like in the apartment building that burned in the crash . Two members that went missing and there 's plenty to keep both you and Lt .  Decker guessing-and chasing . Kellerman surrounds Decker with a cast of characters that add depth to the story . I felt that the story got bogged down with overly long explanations of the family celebrations of religious holidays and the meals that go with them . I 'd welcome these stories in another type of book but here I felt they slowed the action without adding much meaning . On the other hand the character development of family and friends involved in providing thinking and resources used to solve the case added to the story for me . Armchair Interviews says : Lt .  Decker is back in the thick of things again .","story, stories, characters","Negative, Negative, Positive","commuter plane, apartment building, murders, Pete Decker, team, Roseanne Dresden, husband, police, paramour, affair, pot-smoking church group, Lt.

"The return of Peter and Rina Decker is always welcome . It combines good police procedure and the smell of good food . This novel is no exception . It begins with the crash of a small commuter plane out of Burbank ( Bob Hope ) airport early one morning and the supposed death of an airline steward . When all the victims are accounted for , her body is not identified , although the remains of bones beneath the destroyed structure into which the plane plunged are discovered . Thus begins the hunt for the truth behind the disappearance of two women . The skeleton is finally identified as someone gone missing thirty years before . The stewardess ' body remains the subject of a continued search . Is the husband somehow responsible for her disappearance or even her possible murder ? Or is it a contractor in San Jose with whom she had a brief affair ? What started out as two unrelated incidents draws Decker and his team back and forth to San Jose and New Mexico in an effort to uncover 30-year-old information in attempt to solve the cases . With more questions than answers the investigation unearths more dead ends than answers . But perseverance is virtue that pays off in the end . And the interrelationship of Peter and Rina is on display deeply , as she provides a sounding board to guide him both supernaturally and professionally .

"After a plane crashes in a residential Los Angeles neighborhood , Lieutenant Peter Decker is quick on the scene . As the smoke clears , it seems there is little for him left to do but be thankful that his daughter 's nearby school was n't affected by the crash , and the scene becomes one of search and investigation . But Decker soon receives a phone call . An irate man insists that his stepdaughter , although listed as a casualty , was not on the plane at all . In fact , the caller says , she was murdered by her husband . And so Decker faces the wreckage once more as he tries to find out what really happened to Roseanne Dresden . In Faye Kellerman 's latest effort , earthy Peter Decker is back to solve another crime along with colleagues Marge Dunn and Scott Oliver , and his clever and beautiful wife , Rina Lazarus . Like all past Decker/Lazarus novels , THE BURNT HOUSE combines compelling police work with engaging domestic scenes and adds Kellerman 's trademark touch of religious interest . What other literary cop out there is a practicing Orthodox Jew ? Even though Roseanne 's family has no evidence to prove foul play , Decker follows up on their hunch . It pays off . It turns out that hers is the only body not recovered from the crash site , and her husband may have had motive to kill her . Decker , Dunn and Oliver begin to investigate in earnest and find that while Roseanne 's body is missing , another , unidentified body has turned up . Now they have two murders to investigate . Decker and his team work hard to uncover the truth not only about Dresden but also about the mysterious corpse found in the building the plane crashed into . Their work takes them from Los Angeles to Santa Fe where they meet a family who has been in mourning for 30 years . They track down members of a defunct church and Roseanne 's lover , and visit an elderly man in prison . What can all these leads tell them , and what might they have in common ? As always , Kellerman makes a point to illustrate both the uniqueness and normalcy of being an observant Jew in America . Decker negotiating meals , which most people take for granted , is interesting ; it is easier for him to say he is a vegetarian than to say he keeps kosher . Rina 's religious ideas and spirituality are thought provoking , giving the reader -- - through her conversations with her husband and others -- - new ways to think about guilt , innocence , sin and the importance of family . THE BURNT HOUSE is a great read with the right number of twists and turns and the always reliable character of Peter Decker . Some coincidences may be a bit of a stretch , and there is less Rina Lazarus than some fans might want . But Kellerman 's pace and dialogue are as good as ever . This is a recommendable novel to transition readers from light summer reads to darker , more thoughtful winter tomes . -- - Reviewed by Sarah Rachel Egelman","novel--twists and turns, novel--Rina Lazarus, novel--Kellerman 's pace and dialogue, novel--Peter Decker, novel","Positive, Negative, Positive, Positive, Mixed","plane crash, Lieutenant Peter Decker, daughter's nearby school, search and investigation, stepdaughter, husband, Roseanne Dresden, colleagues Marge Dunn and Scott Oliver, Rina Lazarus, police work, domestic scenes, religious interest, body not recovered, motive to kill, mysterious corpse, Los Angeles, Santa Fe, family in mourning, defunct church, lover, elderly man in prison, observant Jew, meals, vegetarian, kosher, religious","Negative, Positive, Positive, Positive, Negative, Negative, Positive, Positive, Positive, Positive, Positive, Positive, Positive, Positive, Positive, Positive, Positive, Positive, Positive, Positive, Positive, Positive, Positive, Positive, Positive, Positive, Positive, Positive, Positive, Positive, Positive, Positive,"
"Is it an unwriiten rule that book series have a limited lifespan and that they will ultimately disappoint their fans . This book is the latest evidence pointing to that rule .

"I have read many of Faye Kellerman 's Peter Decker/Rina Lazarus novels and enjoyed them . This has a very exciting start with a small commuter plane crashing into an apartment building near the school that Hannah , Peter and Rina 's daughter , goes to . All onboard the plane are dead . The airline lists 48 passengers and crew . Forty-eight bodies are recovered but one body is NOT from the crash and had died many years ago . Some of the plots to solve are who is the mystery body and where is the 48th passenger ? There are lots of twists and turns that make at least the first two-thirds of the book very exciting . I did feel that the final denouement was a bit pat and there were a few too many coincidences . Still a good read though . My real problem is that I did n't feel that Rina Lazarus really had a substantial role in this book as she has had in others . She cooked and she worried and she comforted , which are all great things to do . However , the book jacket said that Peter and Rina 's faith would be tested and so on . This did n't happen at all . I would like to see a bigger role for Rina and a few less coincidences .

"I keep coming back for a glimpse of these characters and what they used to bring to Kellerman novels . The series continues to disappoint . Ridiculous and contrived plot aside , laughably stilted writing aside , is it really too much to ask for a basic editing -- perhaps even a simple run-through by any real cop or lawyer ? For example , are readers not entitled to the respect of not having Pete Decker , a character purported to have decades of experience in law enforcement , spout such silly mistakes as ( p. 388 ) that a wife is not required to expose any crimes that [ her ] husband may have done and confided as a matter of ... ... the Fifth Amendment ? Please . Just about anyone who\ 's ever even watched an episode of Law & Order could have explained to Ms .  Kellerman the evidentiary concept of marital privilege/disqualification , and that it has nothing to do with the Fifth Amendment . I\ 've given up on expecting great writing and insightful character development . I\ 've now given up on thinking that the author is even interested in giving the barest attention to her writing .

"This book will delight those who like mysteries that are very difficult to solve before the author reveals the story 's resolution . If you mainly read the Peter Decker/Rina Lazarus books to focus on their life together , you 'll think this is one of the worst books in the series . If you like puzzles , however , you 'll feel fully rewarded by the challenging of determining what happened to flight attendant , Roseanne Dresden . Along the way , you 'll pick up some unexpected twists that also make for good mystery reading . This plot relies on a lot of coincidences . That can be troubling for a reader to swallow , but in real life coincidence occurs so often that we often do n't even bother to remark on it . There is a subgenre of police procedural that relies on having more than one case mixed up in an investigation . I thought that the premise for this mystery was stronger than most books in that subgenre . But what distinguished the book was that the resolutions proved to be so difficult to anticipate . I dislike mysteries where you can see the solution beginning to take shape around page 50 . In this case , Ms .  Kellerman did an excellent job of keeping the resolution hidden until very near the end . From reading this book , I hope that Ms .  Kellerman will write more books that contain difficult puzzles whose solutions only gradually reveal themselves through police investigations . Bravo , Ms .

"I was so looking forward to reading this book ! I 'm a huge fan of the whole Peter Decker/Rina Lazarus series of books , but this was one huge disappointment , from start to finish . The book starts out on a high note , fast paced , exciting , with a plane crash in a densely populated neighborhood in suburban Los Angeles , but the characters are linked by a series of improbable coincidences that only become more ridiculous as the story unfolds . These kinds of plot potholes are so unlike Faye Kellerman that one has to wonder if she was n't comatose when she penned these words to paper . Peter Decker and his LAPD associates spend way too much time and taxpayer expense flying to different locales to interview witnesses , endless hours following up slim threads of leads . For anyone even remotely familiar with police procedure , these details will ring entirely false . Did n't Peter Decker ever hear of something called a telephone ? A minor quibble , perhaps , but it is just one example of the lack of quality that is found in the pages of this novel especially when compared to the high quality of Faye Kellerman 's earlier books .","Peter Decker/Rina Lazarus series, novel--starts, novel--quality, novel--details, novel","Positive, Positive, Negative, Negative, Mixed","book, Peter Decker/Rina Lazarus series, disappointment, characters, plot potholes, Faye Kellerman, LAPD associates, police procedure, quality","Positive, Positive, Negative, Negative, Negative, Negative, Negative, Negative, Negative"

After that big build-up , the actual plot was somewhat of a let-downI enjoy Rina as a character but in this book she was mostly relegated to cooking . More Rina next time , please . A good mystery will get me to overlook the elements that strain believability . In this book I found myself getting distracted by the thought that it would be no wonder the LAPD has budget problems if they really do fly several people around to different cities when one would be enough . It seemed hard to believe they would send 3 officers and a civilian to another state to show a picture to the parents of the possible victim of a decades old crime .

I have to admit I had trouble putting this book down for the first 200 pages or so ... up till Kellerman throws her readers a curve with an improbable coincidence . After that I skimmed through to the ending , which definitely does not live up to the first third of the book . Apart from the ending , the book could have been cut by at least 100 pages . We get details of forensic techniques . We get descriptions of what everyone was wearing , even some minor characters . And we get too much details of police interrogations . I also can\'t help wondering if the LAPD would invest substantial resources to fly to another state for a cold case . And some of the airline information didn\'t seem quite right . All in all , frustrating to get so interested and then deal with an anticlimax ending . Great writing -- just needed some heavy-handed edits .

The whole Alexander\ 's Tomb race is a hodge podge and by the time it is finally found -- it is an anti-climax . You will find some of the most wooden support characters .

"This is a genre I absolutely love - combining historical fact with fiction . Will Adams has admirably done both in The Alexander Cipher . This was Adam 's debut novel - and the first in the Daniel Knox series . Knox is an Egyptologist . His primary interest is in Alexander the Great . For years , historians and archaeologists have been trying to find the final resting place of this fabled leader . When an unexplored catacomb is uncovered during the building of a parking lot , it may hold some answers . There are many groups who want to be the ones to find Alexander . For a group bent on restoring Macedonia to it 's former glory , they see this discovery as a catalyst to further their cause and will stop at nothing . For Daniel , it would be the find of his life , but will it be at the cost of his life ? The story cuts between seemingly disparate stories in the beginning , but all are connected to Alexander and his lost tomb . Adams gives us enough history to whet our curiosity , but not so much that your eyes glaze over . Many times I went and googled part of the story , fascinated with the history Adams presents . The undercurrents of greed , betrayal and manipulations are skillfully combined with history to produce a novel full of action , intrigue and adventure . The thrill of discovering the unknown is conveyed in his writing . Fans of Steve Berry , Dan Brown , Clive Cussler and James Rollins would enjoy this book .","book--history, book--writing, book--genre, book--Adams, book","Positive, Positive, Positive, Positive, Positive",,
"This was a first good attempt by Will Adams in his attempt at fiction . He obviously has done his homework in terms of history , and his own background is well established by his knowledge of the content/geographic locale in which the book takes place . However , in reading this novel , you end up asking yourself if you\ 've ever watched a movie where EVERYTHING was just too conveniently CO-mingled , and the realism went out the door ? Despite the differences in characters , by the end of the novel , it\ 's like this guy was trying to write the next Guy Ritchie script using an inbred family from Appalachia . The Characters all seem to have a history with one another , literally - all of them are within the 2nd degree of separation ( ref : 6 degrees theory ) . I\ 'm not going to give things away because the plot is well founded and makes for great reading . But the way Will Adams put this thing together , it would make for a better movie script than an actual novel . Now , don\'t get me wrong , and you may disagree with this . But every author writes in their own style/syntax - it seems as though Adams is trying to come into his own . There is a great deal of confusion in terms of character references . He uses a lot of pronouns without a lot of congruence . There are times when there are 2 or more characters involved in an event and it becomes a chore in deciding who the F # just said/did/or is the author referring ? ! Again , I will say that this was a good read . It would have been better , had Adams put this novel through at least one more edit . The main story , the overall plot , and its originality are great . The characters are so-so , the back story of the characters is very blah ( because of the co-mingling of their fates - seriously , it\ 's like a red-neck family feud set in Egypt ) . I\ 'm sorry ... no one group of strangers can be so intermingled - and then flip-flopped into knowing each other because of the central belief of a deranged lunatic and his son - especially in a place so big as the Mediterranean . Which brings me to my harshest critique - the author is writing in English . But it\ 's like he\ 's writing Americans , Greeks , Frenchman , Australians , and Arabs like a Briton . I\ 'm not being racist , but there are certain things that different people of the world say in terms of their manner , syntax , and slang . The text didn\'t come across that way . The characters were dynamic to a certain degree , but it came across a bit contrived . That and the fact that again , the pronouns ( He , She , and They ) were so overused that you couldn\'t readily tell who was doing what , without doing a double take . Overall - the book has the potential to be a better movie script . A novel ... not so much . A historical view of some really neat facts on Alexander , Ptolemy , and the chaos that still plagues Egypt regarding her history - absolutely a find . To the author ...  . try a bit more editing on the next story . But hey if you can sell this one to Hollywood ... do it !","one--main story, one, one--character references, one--characters, one--plot, one--originality, one--overall plot, one--back story of the characters, This","Positive, Mixed, Negative, Negative, Positive, Positive, Positive, Negative, Positive",,
"Will Adams joined a Washington based firm of business history consultants , where he wrote a number of corporate histories and biographies . After working in London for a while , he resigned and sold his home to give himself the opportunity of fulfilling a lifelong ambition to become a writer . If this first novel is anything to go by he will achieve his ambition , with many more books to follow this one and I for one will look forward to reading them . There has been a spate of novels about that delve back into history . Usually the plot mimics the now infamous Dan Brown book , the Da Vinci Code . It now seems to be the done thing to slate this particular book at every opportunity but I ca n't help it , I enjoyed that book and also some of the ones that were published on the back of it 's success . This book however is a little different and concentrates on the greed of treasure hunter 's , rather than a race against time to save the world from imminent disaster . The overwhelming greed of a number of people rushing to uncover , what in all probability will be the greatest treasure ever found , surpassing even that of the Egyptian Pharaoh Tutankhamun . The tomb of Alexander the Great , one of the most important men in history , has been sought for centuries , but no one has ever come close to revealing the place of his burial . That is until a group of construction workers unwittingly dig open the entrance of an Alexandrian catacomb and the race is on to find the final resting place of Alexander himself .

The action was there in balance with intellectual , historical retelling , as well as the recounting of a few myths too . The Egyptian setting developed too , travelling from one side of Egypt to the other . Yes , it is slightly unoriginal , especially in today 's market , but that does n't mean you still can not enjoy it for what it is . The 'baddies ' are a little cliched , but again , entertaining .

"A friend gave this book to me cause she thought I might like it . Its about Alexander the Great and I love all things Alexander the Great . Im from Macedonia so that makes sense . Yeah . Its a history inspired , mystery kind of book ( what a sentence huh ? ) . Its about the search for Alexanders tomb . There is this rich family that supports archaelogical research involving Macedonia . There are other people that just want the gold that is supposed to be in the tomb . Others are thrown in for good measure . To balance things out . Things I loved about this book : the mystery , the historical events that inspired it and the archaeology thing . At one point in my life I really wanted to be an archaeologist so I like books about that . I can tell the author has done his research . He has included some historically relevant facts , but also a good dose of fiction . Another thing is the characters . The main male character is called Daniel . He is this adventurous , well educated and good looking guy . ( I may be a bit biased cause my boyfriend is called Daniel ; ) ) All the male characters are really strong in this book . The females have strong wits , but they 're not up for action . Theres is a change in this towards the end . I shouldnt go in depth cause I might spoil the book for you . Now , moving on to some things I did n't quite like . Some parts of the book are just boring . Explanations about this and that are very long . Parts of the story are unclear . For example , the rich family I mentioned . Theyre portrayed like people fighting for the Macedonian cause , but it seems they only want their name to become well known worldwide . Either that or theres a major point Im missing here . I think the Macedonian cover is way nicer than the one shown above . The picture below is of the Macedonian cover . There is a map of Macedonia and all the territories Alex conquered , a treasure chest and its written in a really cool font . Not that the other one is n't nice with the symbol of Macedonia and everything . Its just that the cover of the Macedonian translation is nicer . Rating 4 stars .

There is a vast mass of information here that is fascinating , but unfortunately , it is impossible to differentiate between what is true and what is fiction . Furthermore , while Adams is a good writer , so much prose is too dense to really be interesting . Page after page reads like a college text , and not a good one . It is extremely annoying that Adams continually switches back and forth between various characters and their adventures , almost always leaving them in deep peril , as though this is his only hope that the reader will continue to plod on . Not a good device . Actually due to this , I fail to see why he even bothered to create different chapters . Not having a deep knowledge of the various places where action takes place , it is very confusing to figure out just where things are heading , with the exception of some of the more well-known cities or regions of Egypt . The adventures of Knox are completely ridiculous and absurd , reading more like a comic book . Nobody in the history of the world has been mired in deep peril , and escaped it so many times . He even surpasses Superman . Almost all the adventures of different characters are often unbelievable , but none so much as SuperKnox , who escapes innumerable attempts on his life . The ending is somewhat amusing to see finally how he escapes serving a decade in an Egyptian prison . I ca n't deem the novel as all bad , but be prepared to page through a lot of unintelligible trivia . And totally suspend disbelief .","novel--information, novel--Adams, novel--prose, novel--device, novel","Mixed, Positive, Negative, Negative, Mixed",,
"ALEXANDER CIPHER joins a very crowded archeological field and does n't do much to distinguish itself from all the others . A fairly good plot , some very good historical information , but with very cookie cutter characters - the hero who gets in and out of trouble repeatedly , the villains who are after the hero but continue to miss their opportunity to put an end to him , the sidekick who helps the hero out of several jams , and in this case unlike some others in this space , a rather weak female lead . Descriptions of the sites are done very well and at a good level of detail , putting you right there with the characters . There is plenty of action , but the author presents some of the action in a very disjointed manner , jumping from situation 1 to situation 2 to situation 3 and back again very quickly , ruining some of the continuity of the action . A plus for me was the relatively low romantic activity in the book . It is definitely more action oriented in mix than some others on this subject . All in all , and OK read - just nothing very good or terribly bad . If you are a fan of this type of action / adventure genre , it should meet your basic requirements .","Descriptions, author, read--characters, read, read--plot, read--historical information","Positive, Negative, Negative, Mixed, Positive, Positive",,
"Starting off , I am a huge fan of this genre . This book fell flat . I will say that the author did a great job of researching the region . It set a great backdrop for the novel . I was first irritated by how all the major players were linked in two or fewer degrees . It 's a small world , but not that small . The slang terms used by people from different countries were wrong . Better research next time , please . There were way too many minor stories going on and it distracted from the main story . The ending was rushed . After all the buildup I felt let down .","genre, novel, novel--ending, novel--author, novel--story, novel--job","Positive, Mixed, Negative, Positive, Negative, Positive",,
"I homeschool my son , who is currently doing a paper on Alexander the Great . When we looked Alexander up in the library system , this book popped up as well . It looked interesting , so I checked it out for myself . The plot is quite good , though as other reviewers have pointed out , the intermingling of the character relationships is just too easy and convenient . I get the whole 6 degrees of separation , especially in a field like archaeology , which is n't huge , but it was a bit too much for my liking . Maybe had there been more than one person between the character relationships I would have found it easier to accept . My biggest issue with the book is how very much history is in the book . Do n't get me wrong , I 'm a history geek and I appreciate that the author has clearly done his research ( having visited both Alexandria and Cairo , I found his descriptions of the cities and sights to be spot on ) , and knowing much Greek , Macedonian and Egyptian history , I appreciate that , but I , the reader , do n't need to know it all to understand the book . At times I felt like he was just throwing in every single historical detail he had at the book . Some passages seemed like I was reading a history text rather than a novel . I think some of the details could have been left out and explanations made simpler . I found it hard to believe in many cases that so many archaeologists and people specializing in Egypt , would n't know some of the stuff the other characters explained . I get that most of it was for the reader 's sake , but again , it could have been shortened by a lot . Overall though , I did like the book and found the plot interesting . I would have liked for Knox to be a bit more multi-faceted , and Gaille to be more assertive , especially when it came to Elena ( who I wanted to smack almost every time she was around ) , but for a first novel , I can forgive these things . I did like how passionate many of the people were about the subject though , especially Ibrahim , who I wanted to see more of . While this book was n't the greatest I 've ever read , it was n't bad , and I might give Adams ' other books a go .","book--author, book--book, book--details","Mixed, Mixed, Negative",,

"An unconquerable warrior king , Alexander was the single most powerful man on the planet and thought to be a god . Now , nearly 2,500 years later , the discovery of his tomb , seemingly lost forever , is within reach , triggering a deadly hunt for one of the greatest treasures of all time . Knox is not the only seeker ; others are after the prize , and they would kill to win it . -Amazon . comWhat do you get when you cross Alexander the Great , Homer ( not Simpson ) and Ancient Egyptian lore ? You get The Alexander Cipher -- a race to discover the lost tomb of the ancient world\ 's greatest warrior . Anyone who\ 's met me knows that I\ 'm a self-professed historical fiction/adventure enthusiast . If Indiana Jones had a secret affair with Michael Bay , the resulting love-child would be my favourite kind of book . Something like , say , this one . Written in the style of Clive Cussler or Steve Berry , Adams has crafted a riveting narrative full of action and adventure with a twist of compelling mystery . Alexander the Great is an incredibly intriguing figure and it\ 's evident that Adams has done his homework . His research blurred the lines between fact and fiction seamlessly and there\ 's definitely something to be said for that . The main problem I\ 've found with this genre is that there\ 's a thin line between need-to-know fact and tedious detail . Many novels go so far in-depth with the facts that you\ 're left feeling like you\ 're sitting in a classroom . Adams balances the nitty gritty detail with just enough flair to keep you feeling engaged , not bored . There are plot twists and cliff-hangers looming around every corner ; enough to keep you on your toes . Any novel that can blend the likes of history with the throes of an edgy thriller is a total winner in my book . I guess my only real problem with The Alexander Cipher was the lack of an appealing main character . It\ 's not that they weren\'t likeable , for all intensive purposes , they could be worse ; it\ 's just that they aren\'t notably strong . Adams missed the mark in making our main man , Daniel Knox , identifiable . He\ 's an enigma with one too many personality shifts -- American to British to Egyptian -- it\ 's just distracting . Our leading lady , Gaille , is way too weak and fickle for my tastes . One minute she hates Knox and the next minute she loves him . I couldn\'t quite keep track . And look , I get it . Archaeologists aren\'t action heroes . Understood . But would it have been too much to ask to take a little fire from Gaille\ 's overbearing boss , Elena , and shove it into her instead ? Her timid act was just not relatable from a reader\ 's standpoint . I wanted to shake the meekness right out of her the entire time I was reading . While this might seem like a huge issue ( believe me , in most cases it is ) Adams supplements this loss with an amazing cast of supporting characters . Tell me you\ 're not intrigued by a man like Mohammed , who risked everything to save the life of his terminally ill daughter . Tell me you wouldn\'t like to kick some serious ass with the likes of Knox\ 's Aussie pal , Rick . Tell me you weren\'t floored by the dedication of Dr .  Ibrahim Beyumi . I\ 've never seen someone who loves their job so much and it\ 's inspiring . Oh and the honorable goon Nessin . Honorable goon ? An oxymoron , yes , but still true nonetheless . These guys are worth reading about and these guys made me overlook the book\ 's inherit flaws . Girlish side note here : I have a bit of a bookish crush on Knox\ 's wayward friend , Augustin . He\ 's just so damn charming ! I\ 'd be like total putty in those French hands of his ! Despite the book\ 's shortcomings , all in all , the twists and turns kept me satisfied enough to overlook them . There was an unpredictability in where Adams was going with storyline and enough action to keep the Bay in me at bay . When I finish a historical book and feel an immediate thirst for more knowledge on said subject , I know something was done right . The Alexander Cipher accomplished such a task and did exactly what a book of this genre should do -- kept me turning the page and wanting for more . Food for Thought : This genre is my total guilty pleasure and with that being said , it\ 's tough to disappoint . But in a sea of Dan Brown wannabe\ 's , Will Adams\ ' debut novel stands strong on its own two feet . I\ 've read the second in the series and do look forward to reading more from him . Adams has found himself a dedicated new fan ! And if you prefer the auditory experience , I\ 've listed to the audiobook , it comes highly recommended . Rating : 3 . 5/5 stars","Alexander Cipher, Alexander Cipher--narrative, \ ' debut novel--guys, Alexander Cipher--main character, \ ' debut novel, Alexander Cipher--plot twists, Gaille, Alexander Cipher--Knox, \ ' debut novel--twists and turns, Alexander Cipher--Adams, Alexander Cipher--mystery, Alexander Cipher--cliff-hangers, it","Mixed, Positive, Positive, Negative, Mixed, Positive, Negative, Negative, Positive, Mixed, Positive, Positive, Positive",,

This book is actually the first one in a long while to fulfill my expectations in that regard , with Will Adams able to incorporate an unbelievable amount of history into his story . The basic story is : Daniel Knox , archeologist , ends up on the wrong side of nearly everyone in Egypt ( or so it seems ) . At the same time , a hotel owner in Alexandria discovers a necropolis on his building site . Add in intrigue with regards to the Macedonian freedom movement , a whole slew of people from Knox 's past filling out the supporting roles , and a mystery that spans eons ( and has yet to be solved ) and you 've got the makings of a taught historical thriller . As mentioned above , I started this book as an audiobook ( but then finished it in print because I just could n't wait to see what happened ) , and the narrator does a spectacular job with all of the different voices and accents .

"Admittedly , I am a sucker for a good archeological thriller . In The Alexander Cipher we have a pretty good example of the genre .

All the while , he\ 's on the run from an Egyptian mobster ( for lack of a better term ) who is out to kill him . Like most thrillers , there are a whole lot of threads being slowly woven together here . There are hidden relationships between all the main characters which are gradually revealed as the story progresses . There is plenty of action as they make their way to the hidden tomb . And , to Mr .  Adams\ ' credit , he doesn\'t stint on the archeological find , as sometimes happens in these novels . The history and discovery is all here in its exciting , if fictional , glory . My only real complaint about the novel is the level of violence . All thrillers have violence , of course , but it often comes across as more cartoon-like violence than anything . Here we have attempted rapes , beatings , attempted murders , and murders that seem much more realistic and in-your-face than usual . It\ 's not really my cup of tea . Still , excepting that , this is really a solid novel .

"Will Adams creates a new thriller character destined to be a long-running series of best sellers . Daniel Knox is a knock-around archaeologist in Egypt with a history of interesting relationships with his brethren and sponsors . The supervisor of a construction project in Alexandria stumbles onto a potential site of the final resting place of Alexander the Great , whose body was coveted as a justification for power by his successors in Egypt , the Ptolemys , Alexander 's native Macedonians . The race begins in the fashion of an Indiana Jones movie . Knox is pursued by a bad guy for saving a young girl from being raped by the tyrant . Along the way , there is a budding love affair with a woman who blamed Knox for the odd death of her archaeologist father , an evil female colleague who seems easily seduced by lovers and sources of money , a little girl desperately in need of a bone marrow transplant , rich Macedonian nationalists intent on using Alexander 's body as the means , after more than 2,000 years , of fomenting revolution to establish a separate Macedonia out of Greece and Balkan states . The Alexander Cipher beautifully blends the history of Alexander and his successors into an entertaining , rip-roaring , action-packed , page-turning adventure . The past of Daniel also will not remain there , as the female protagonist in the story , Gillie , moves from a hatred attributable to the strange death of her father to something more beautiful . This is an excellent , well-crafted story . It cries out for a sequel in the adventures of Daniel Knox .","Alexander Cipher--story, Alexander Cipher--character, Alexander Cipher","Positive, Positive, Positive",,
"The Alexander Cipher , by Will Adams , has many elements of a gripping Dan Brown novel but falls short . The mix of historical fact and fiction become an adventure in Egypt , but the subplots beneath it all tend to bubble over the top for this reader .

"I would have to say that the story was definitely interesting . A search for Alexander the Great 's long-lost tomb , and to find his body , who could resist a novel like that . However , too many hidden agendas and shifting allegiances brought a good story down . My Egyptian , Macedonian and Greek history is definitely rusty . The author did impress me with his knowledge of all three and throw in some seamless fiction into the works too . Throw in a few lines from The Iliad and Homer and other sources about the Gordian knot that Alexander had to cut and the prophecy that went with it . However , some of the sub-plots , personal histories and personal vendettas convoluted the star attraction , finding Alexander 's tomb . It became more of a personal chase from one desert to another and back again . Sorry for this small paragraph of spoilers , but too much emphasis on one tomb and lifting the plinth . Daniel Knox , the man who could escape virtually any situation ? I also did n't know that Egyptians or the people who operated in Egypt were so advance that they could track anyone if they turned on their mobile . Granted , the technology is available , but was it absolutely plausible to do that throughout the entire novel ? It did n't feel credible . Was everyone working with CIA-technology ? I was also absolutely disappointed that Rick had to die , because Daniel and Rick did make a good team , albeit better than Daniel did with Gaielle . Of course , they did eventually find Alexander 's tomb and his mummified remains . The eventual move to move his body back to Macedonia , and the press conference and corruption of the Egyptian antiquities people just made everything too convenient to end the story . It definitely stopped looking like anything from an Indiana Jones adventure probably after they lifted the plinth and then mutated into something beyond comprehension . I was sorely disappointed .

"The Alexander Cipher is a prototypical summer read . After a prologue , the main story starts out with an improbable rescue of a lady-in-distress , and at that point , I questioned whether I would finish the book .

Do n't look for characters to react realistically to injury . But the fundamental premise is fun , and the rapid-fire finish is a wild ride , with the author finally stepping outside of being trite and concluding with an odd partnership to round up the bad guys .

"The Alexander Cipher by Will Adams is an adventurous novel that has it all .

Sort of like Matthew Reilly , but better edited , without all the damn italics and exclamation points ! ! ( Sorry , when I think Reilly , I think ! ! OH BOY ! ! Exclamation points ! ! ! ) But , I digress ...  . Will Adams debut novel features a sort of nere'do well Egyptologist that everyone seems to love to hate , Daniel Knox , whose life long interest in Alexander the Great puts him right in the thick of things when the novels bad guy..the slightly crazy and wildly wealthy Nicolas Dragoumis , learns of that Alexander 's tomb may have been discovered . Nicolas has some wacky belief that the tomb contains secrets and treasures that will cause Macedonia to become an independent state once more , and he has the wealth , power and obsession to see his beliefs through . Its up to our hero , Daniel , and of course , his newly discovered gorgeous sidekick , Gaille , to stop him and save the antiquities . ( Sort of like an Indiana Jones meets James Bond thing , but without MI-6 and spiffy weapons and toys . ) And of course , there is history between Gaille and Daniel that has to be resolved for their adventure to be a success . I 'm a bit of an ancient history buff , so I found the well-researched novel interesting , although occasionally confusing . There is a large cast of characters and apparently my old brain had a little trouble keeping up . Once I figured everyone out though , I really enjoyed the book .

"I listened to The Stranger as an audiobook while exercising . It was good enough that it made me look forward to going to the gym or riding the exercise bike at home . The Stranger is a weak title , but I suppose other titles might have given something away . Ill try to avoid spoilers in this review as well . This is the fourth of the Patrik Hedstrom detective novels ; it was titled The Gallows Bird previously , which is no better title for the interconnected mysteries that make this novel interesting . As usual for this series , Patrik and the detectives are working on solving one murder , and there is a story occurring much earlier that is described in vaguer terms but which the reader knows must have some relation to the crime . This novel is even more complex than the earlier three in this series because there is another crime that the detectives are working on simultaneously with the murder that occurs earlier in the book . I found the complex plot engaging . However , I usually was disappointed when Lackberg returned to the narrative dealing with a reality show being televised in the area . The fan culture and shallow contestants on the reality show were unpleasant , so I wished Lackberg had introduced another novel plot line instead of the reality show . As usual , the characters , both good and bad , were well developed . I enjoyed the fact that Patriks partner Ericka Falck was coming out of the postpartum depression that dominated her character in The Stonecutter . Erickas sister Anna also got herself to a better psychological place . I agree with another reviewer who found the cause of Anna 's improvement unlikely to have been that effective , but that is a minor issue compared to Lackbergs artful development of the characters of the detectives and possible perpetrators . Lackberg shares the childhood development of quite a few characters , making their behavior more understandable and the reader more sympathetic to them .

"Its easy to see how Camilla Lckberg has become Swedens bestselling native authorand how her detective novels have proven so popular in translation . Her Fjllbacka series is peopled with complex and interesting people who grow from book to book , and each mystery is unique . A central cast of characters appears in each , but it changes in natural ways . Nothing stands still in these novels . Camilla Lckberg has a well-developed understanding of the twists and turns in human development . If anything , however , her view of human nature is dark . The mood that prevails in the Fjllbacka series rarely reaches the levels of depression and despair found in Henning Mankells Kurt Wallander books , or in Jo Nesbs Harry Hole novels . But these are not happy stories . Human folly frequently comes to the surface here . Somehow , it all seems natural for a Swedish writer . In The Stranger , the fourth entry in the Fjllbacka series , detective Inspector Patrik Hedstrm and true-crime writer Ericka Falck are raising their months-old daughter , Maya . Or , rather , Ericka is doing all the work . Patriks job regularly intrudes . To compound Erickas problem , her wedding is imminent , and shes been unable to find the time to make any plans . To make matters even worse , her younger sister , Anna , and two young children have moved into the house . Anna is in a deep depression after killing her abusive husband in self-defense , leaving Ericka to raise all three childrenand , presumably , to make all the arrangements for the wedding . Then Patriks sporadic help at home dries up almost completely as he is assigned a brutal and baffling case . A middle-aged woman stinking of alcohol has driven her car off the road and crashed into a tree , apparently either an accident or a suicide . Patrik is n't so sure , though . And it soon becomes clear that his doubts are well placed . Meanwhile , a tasteless reality TV show has set up shop in a small town bordering Fjllbacka . Goaded by the shows producer , six young people are indulging in a toxic mix of alcohol , hard drugs , and sex on camera . Then one of the six , a 19-year-old woman , is murdered , too . Suddenly , Patrik and his colleagues on the police force are strained by investigations into two murders . And one of them is making front-page news all across Sweden because it involves the countrys top-rated reality show . Every one of the Fjllbacka novels is eventful to a fault . A large cast of characters requires both concentration and a good memory , as Lckberg constantly shifts perspective from one to another . In The Stranger , we become enmeshed in the lives of every one of Patriks colleagues , from the hapless and stupid chief of police to the new female detective who joins the force . Patriks mother , Erickas sister , and her ex-lover all emerge in three dimensions as well . And throughout the book , in a brief reflective passage at the beginning of each chapter , we enter the mind of a man who will clearly emerge with a key role in the story . If your taste runs to intellectually challenging fare in detective fiction , youll love the Fjllbacka series .","Fjllbacka series--people, detective novels, Fjllbacka series--mystery, book--Camilla Lckberg, Fjllbacka series","Positive, Positive, Positive, Positive, Positive",,

"I read Lackberg fairly regularly , these mysteries are like a domestic novel of manners hung around a who dunnit but Lackberg is so good hearted I like to follow an author likeJames Elroy ( The Big Nowhere ) or Lee Child ( Jack Reacher ) with s nice story about people who are motivated by aspirations other than malice and/or justice which seems mostly to justify violence ( the bad guy gets his reward for being soo nasty ) You come to like all the characters and evil is the expression of past extreme evil . It leaves you with a notion that with a return to common sense the world is lolerable . These are not the the chill of other Nordic Noir but are not as neatsy as Agatha Christy but not as dark as Mankell or even Nesbo and Edwardson .","Lee Child , likeJames Elroy , characters","Positive, Positive, Positive",,
lackberg is a major writer . She has mastered the art of both description and dialogue to create characters who resemble living and breathing human beings . When I read her books which I enjoy immensely I do n't care about the whodunit aspect but the situations which the characters find themselves in  . which makes the stories so memorable  .

The plot moved along at a good pace and there were some twists and turns until Patrik was able to solve the murders . I was not prepared for the outcome of the investigation and was quiet surprised . Lackberg gives more insight into Patrk and Erica , as well as into Melberg , who finds himself ready to throw caution to the wind with a new love interest . What was a bit unrealistic was Anna 's sudden recovery from her depression - it ended rather abruptly and did not seem plausible but her new relationship was very predictable..

The dialogues are boring , repetitive , the preparation for the wedding go on and one , and the worst , are the unformulated intuitions that the detectives have , that leave us readers hanging in the air .

The writing has improved with each new novel with more clarity and focus on material valuable and relevant to the storyline . Learning about the culture , mores , and Swedish countryside is an enjoyable element to these books . The books are filled with many characters who , at times , are hard to remember and track their value to the story . But many of these ancillary characters have a great deal of tumult in their lives - divorce , spousal abuse , death , financial difficulties , and murder but Patrick and Erica remain anchored with traditional life challenges . I do like these two primary characters and am now immersed in their world and what will happen to them in the future . Even though a more dominant player in the first book , Erica now finds herself an at home sounding board for Patrick as he works his way to solving the crimes . I found the story in this book the least complex of the first four in the series , although interesting and enjoyable .

"In this novel accidental death is revealed as murder . But the autopsy reveals that death was caused by a great amount of alcohol and the victim never drank alcohol . There is a family beset with homophobia . There is a new female on Patrik Hedstrom 's team . Erica copes with Maja , her infant daughter , as well as looking after her depressed sister and her children . A reality TV programme is being filmed in the area . One of the cast is found dead . Is it accident or murder ? Police chief Mellberg has found true love at last and embarks on an investment . The inevitable happens with that relationship . Erica 's sister Anna finally snaps out of depression with the help of Erica 's ex-boyfriend , Dan and then takes on the challenge of organising Erica and Patrik 's wedding . Several Scandinavian crime novels imploy a technique that is used here : the beginning of each chapter is preceded by a short passage ( in italics ) that reveals , bit by bit , the back-story of the murderer ( s ) . Always a gripping mystery and a satisfying resolution . I found it a little frustrating that we get only a short snapshot of each scene before switching to the next .

"A lackluster selection of audiobooks at my local library sent me back to Lackberg\ 's Fjallbacka series , one I had left for dead after the lackluster second book The Preacher and it\ 's multitude of boring , away-from-the-actual-murder-investigation nonsense . The third book in the series , The Stonecutter once again re-introduced main character Patrik\ 's fiancee into the main plotline , but she again fades to the background in this , the fourth episode . What I loved most about the first book in the series The Ice Princess was Erika\ 's involvement , as she was friends with the victim . When she is less involved in the investigation , the whole thing goes a little awry , as we are treated to long scenes that take away from the plot . Patrik is usually absent , so we get only odd vignettes of what his life must be like at home . Well , The Stranger has fixed a lot of those problems , and while Erika is one subplot , she\ 's not the only one . Melberg is the true star of the subplots here , and I love what they did with his character in this novel . I might just keep reading on , especially now that in the next episode , there promises to be more of the Erika and Patrik interaction that I loved about the first book . Note : this book also appears with the title The Gallows Bird , which is a terrible title . However , The Stranger pretty much causes you to pay a little too much attention to one character in particular , which leaves you a little let down by the ending .","Erika\ 's involvement, Gallows Bird--title, Stranger, Gallows Bird, Preacher--nonsense, Gallows Bird--Erika and Patrik interaction","Positive, Negative, Mixed, Mixed, Negative, Positive",,

"This book was a bit of a let down . It was extremely obvious early on who was behind the murders ... so much so I thought it was intentional .

There 's virtually no suspense and no payoff . We do n't come to care about the victims , and we do n't get to know enough about the killer .

"If you are the type of reader who prefers police procedurals to remain focused on the investigation and to have little to say about anything else , Camilla L & auml ; ckberg 's series is not the one for you . In these Hedstr & ouml ; m and Falck novels , the lives of the police officers are every bit as important as the investigations they work on . For character-driven readers like me , they 're perfect to immerse myself in when I 'm in the mood to spend time with characters who 've come to feel as though they 're friends . You also never know just what 's going to happen , because the lives of these characters do not run smoothly . Hedstr & ouml ; m and Falck have had to learn how to be a couple , how to juggle their separate careers , and how to be parents . Erika 's sister and her two children have had a very difficult time of their own , and we get to see them adjusting to a new chapter in their lives . We know what 's going on in the lives of each person who works with Patrik -- even Melberg , the boss who drives everyone insane . Melberg 's private life comes into the spotlight for a while in The Stranger , and this glimpse gives him an added depth that the usual pain-in-the-neck boss just does n't have in the typical police procedural . The individual cast members of the reality TV show also come under scrutiny since they are all considered suspects . It does sound like a huge cast , but I had no difficulties in keeping everyone straight . The only thing that kept The Stranger from becoming one of my top reads for the year was the fact that the identity of the killer was crystal clear to me very early on . However , I certainly did enjoy watching Hedstr & ouml ; m and his team conduct their investigations into the two deaths , finding clues and piecing them together in this strongest book of the series so far . If you like to learn a bit about another country , be a part of intricate investigations , and immerse yourself in the lives of fictional characters , then I certainly recommend crime fiction written by Camilla L & auml ; ckberg .","crime fiction--Camilla L & auml ; ckberg, characters, book, crime fiction","Mixed, Positive, Mixed, Positive",,

And the ending leaves open for another whole weird drama , which is probably on purpose , to be used later , but to be honest , I do n't think I will go out of my way to find more by this author . I did not get the same feel for Sweden as I have from other authors of similar type books . This could have taken place anywhere . And not in a good way .

"Unlike some other Scandinavian authors , Camilla Lackbergs protagonist , Detective Patrik Hedstrom , is a relatively normal person , about to be married and living with Erica and their baby girl , surreptitiously running the small police station in a little western coastal town in Sweden , Fjallbacka nominally headed by a superior . Three things happen in the town to set off a wide-ranging investigation . First , Fjallbacka is invaded by a reality television show , with all the attendant problems and a cast motivated to drink , have sex and act in public to excess . And then , there is a local woman , known to abhor alcohol , who dies in a car crash with a blood level containing enormously high levels of alcohol . Then one night , after a drunken orgy , one of the contestants on the show is found murdered . Plenty to keep Patrik and his team occupied with few leads and plenty of questions . This is the fourth novel published by the author in the United States , and each has been consistently high quality , well-plotted , carefully translated and well written Perhaps most importantly , the characters are natural , every-day type of people , living typical lives and working hard . The plots move forward with logic , and the loose ends come together at the end smoothly . ( It should perhaps be noted that this book was originally published in the UK and Canada under the title The Gallows Bird . ) Highly recommended .","book--characters, book--quality, book--plots, book","Positive, Positive, Positive, Positive",,

There must have been another way to write their part ; but , I digressAnd finally , some characters are a true testament to narcissism , obnoxiously or sadly so .

I would recommend this author to anyone who enjoyed the Tattoo books .,"book--characters, book--author","Positive, Positive",,

"I normally like everything about the characters and the plots in this series , but in this particular book Lackberg uses a devise way too much so that it becomes irritating . The characters routinely have a thought , memory , that they can\'t quite place that is inevitabley an important clue . Again and again with every character so that it becomes unnatural and an obvious device . Hopefully this won\'t continue in the following books .","book--device, book--Lackberg, series--plots, book, series--characters, book--devise way","Negative, Negative, Positive, Negative, Positive, Negative",,

"Unlike some other Scandinavian authors , Camilla Lackberg\ 's protagonist , Detective Patrik Hedstrom , is a relatively normal person , about to be married and living with Erica and their baby girl , surreptitiously running the small police station in a little western coastal town in Sweden , Fjallbacka nominally headed by a superior . Three things happen in the town to set off a wide-ranging investigation . First , Fjallbacka is invaded by a reality television show , with all the attendant problems and a cast motivated to drink , have sex and act in public to excess . And then , there is a local woman , known to abhor alcohol , who dies in a car crash with a blood level containing enormously high levels of alcohol . Then one night , after a drunken orgy , one of the contestants on the show is found murdered . Plenty to keep Patrik and his team occupied with few leads and plenty of questions . This is the fourth novel published by the author in the United States , and each has been consistently high quality , well-plotted , carefully translated and well written Perhaps most importantly , the characters are natural , every-day type of people , living typical lives and working hard . The plot lines move forward with logic , and the loose ends come together at the end smoothly . ( It should perhaps be noted that this book was originally published in the UK and Canada under the title The Gallows Bird . ) Highly recommended .","book--characters, book--quality, book--plot lines, book","Positive, Positive, Positive, Positive",,
"I 'm trying to put my finger on what made this crime novel so much fun to read . For one thing , it 's a feast of life stories and love stories . There are a great many characters , and their lives are fascinating to follow . There are various couples in various states of bliss , suffering , deception and crisis . And happily , the lead detective , Patrik Hedstrom , is an intelligent , purposeful and essentially happy man in love with his partner , about to marry her , and crazy about their little daughter . This gives an upbeat quality to the narrative , which is very welcome in a mystery full of distressing murders . Yet despite all the human interest , this is a nitty-gritty police procedural replete with autopsies , interviews and research , all well described . The several cops at the Tanumshede police station are engaging and some of them surprise the reader with unexpected insights . I liked them all . Even the unpleasant boss is somewhat sympathetic . While two murder investigations keep the cops busy , a reality show is being filmed in Tanumshede . This adds a nice touch of chaos to the plot . The denouement is full of surprises . I admired the inventiveness of the author in developing the backstory behind the killings . My husband gave me this book . He liked it a lot , so it 's not chick lit , despite the presence of some highly romantic episodes . I found The Stranger a very satisfying read , so much so that I 've ordered four more books by Camilla Lackberg .","read--cops, read--characters, read, read--denouement, them","Positive, Positive, Positive, Positive, Positive",,

"I\ 've read each of Lackberg\ 's other books that have been released in the US in this series , and I\ 've enjoyed each one . I like the way she is able to create character arcs that cross from one book to the next and how her emotional character subplots fill out the gaps of the primary mystery story . I enjoy each of the characters - even the tragic , bumbling Mellberg ( I certainly felt for him in this installment ) . BUT , with each subsequent book , I can\'t help but notice her tremendous reliance on a couple of seriously overused narrative devices . First , she loves the end of chapter cliffhanger . I think these can be super effective , but not when they are the default . But even moreso , she must have had the whole something was tugging at his subconscious , but he couldn\'t quite put his finger on it bit appear at least 8 times in this novel . At a certain point , this trope starts to feel like lazy writing . I think Camilla Lackberg has great ideas , but she needs to veer a little from the formula and be creative . If she keeps leaning on these narrative crutches to create tension , I might not make it through too many more books , which would be too bad .","each one--narrative crutches, each one--narrative devices, each one--characters, each one--way, each one, each one--subplots, these, she","Negative, Negative, Positive, Positive, Mixed, Positive, Negative, Positive",,
"I really enjoyed all of the earlier mysteries by Camilla Lackberg and was looking forward to this one . Unfortunately , it was n't up to par with her past works . The use of the reality show cast while certainly necessary to the plot was I felt just a bad attempt to stay current with the real world . The characters were shallow and right out of central casting . The dialogue used when they were in the book was so bad at times I thought maybe the translation was the problem . I can only hope that in her next novel she writes more as she has in the past and not try to stay so hard with the current real world . The trends will come and go , but her writing should be better and last much longer .","book--dialogue, book, earlier mysteries by Camilla Lackberg, book--characters, book--plot","Negative, Mixed, Positive, Negative, Negative",,
"I have read and enjoyed many Swedish police thrillers of which The Stranger is one . All these have elements in common- primarily the twisted thread of painfully accumulated evidence from interviews and combing records eventually leading up to the capture of the murderer after a violent denoument . Along side the procedural details there are one or more subplots usually involving the policeman\ 's hard lot in maintaining a happy home life in the face of all the long hours he spends on the murder cases . All these elements are present in The Stranger . Parts of the story read like a soap opera as we follow the hero\ 's girl friend planning her wedding , choosing a dress , music for the reception etc . Something that sets The Stranger apart from many others is the large number of named characters-I counted 80 in a 370 page book- many of the 80 were children , or minor characters , but surely this must come close to the records set in Russian novels . The serious part of the plot concerns a rather far-fetched series of revenge murders seemingly unrelated but which the detectives manage to link together and zero in on a very surprising conclusion . Altogether a satisfying read .",read,Positive,,

"Synopsis/blurb ... ... To avoid disappointment , please note this book was previously published under the title THE GALLOWS BIRD . Swedish crime sensation and No . 1 international bestseller , Camilla Lackberg\ 's fourth psychological thriller - for fans of Stieg Larsson and Jo Nesbo . A woman is found dead , apparently the victim of a tragic car crash . It\ 's the first in a spate of seemingly inexplicable accidents in Tanumshede and marks the end of a quiet winter for detective Patrik Hedstrm and his colleagues . At the same time a reality TV show is being shot in the town . As cameras shadow the stars\ ' every move , relations with the locals are strained to breaking point . When a drunken party ends with a particularly unpopular contestant\ 's murder , the cast and crew are obvious suspects . Could there be a killer in their midst ? As the country tunes in , the bodies mount up . Under the intense glare of the media spotlight , Patrik faces his toughest investigation yet ... My wife read this about a month ago , and was quite insistent that I get to it . After all I had inflicted it on her . Suffice to say she didn\'t particularly enjoy it much ; ok - not at all then ! I\ 've been avoiding it for a couple of weeks , in the hope I could delay it until May and count it as my Scandinavian read for the month which is one of my own personal reading challenges in 2013 . One of the many things I love about my wife is her persistence ! This was a 390\'ish page book where not very much seemed to happen at the beginning , other than we spend a lot of time with the chief investigator\ 's family . In fact throughout the book we spend a lot of time with Hedstrom\ 's wife , Erica and sister , Anna ... ... who I\ 'm guessing suffered some event in one of the author\ 's previous books . Most of the time , I enjoy stories where detectives or investigators personal lives are shown to us . I need to see another side to them , apart from the job . It adds flesh to their bones and gives them substance . Here it bored me unfortunately . After maybe the halfway point the pace picked up a bit and there were some interesting developments . The investigation into the car crash victim developed with other similar cases uncovered . I did guess the identity of the killer early , and as I\ 'm no Sherlock Holmes perhaps it wasn\'t concealed as cunningly as the author thought it had been . Conversely , it could have been her intention to telegraph the culprit to the reader . She did cleverly link the two crimes of reality show murder victim and drunk driver together . The supporting cast of police investigators were on the whole likeable and fairly believable . Perhaps my favourite was Gosta . Initially jaded and uninterested , counting down the days until he could get out on the golf course ; he became invigorated and brought his A-game to the investigation . Maybe his transformation stretched the bounds of credibility a little bit , but as I liked him I\ 'll buy this one . There were a couple more downsides to the book in my opinion . I felt the minor back story with the chief of police , Mellberg was clichd and predictable . The ending where she served up a hook for her next book was annoying , irritating and blatantly unsubtle and patronising to an intelligent readership . I enjoyed the second half of the book more than the first , despite the gripes mentioned above . I do have another book of hers to read , The Drowning . It won\'t be something I\ 'll be rushing to in a hurry . As a further sidenote , my 2012 edition states that the author was the 9th best-selling author in Europe in the previous year . She must have a very big family , I reckon . 2 from 5I bought this new for my wife earlier this year from Buzzard Books in my hometown . Perhaps I need help when shopping for my wife ?","book--second half, Gosta, ending, book","Positive, Positive, Negative, Mixed",,
"This was a great little mystery set in Sweden . I loved the way the author built up the mystery and kept adding to it so you got a nice rounded story . There was no pulling out a mystery character at the end , the author drew you toward the final conclusion . Each of the characters in the story were well thought out and gave their own bit of personality to the complete story . The author had several different stories going on at once and I was n't sure how they were all going to be connected at first , but the author did tie everything together gradually through the book so you were n't left out in the field wondering which path was going to lead you to the chocolate prize at the end . Even though this was book 4 in the Fjllbacka stories , I felt that you could read this as a stand-alone without having read the other three . This book was not originally written in English , the translator , Steven T. Murray , did a great job getting the translation correct so it did not feel like I was listening to a book with incorrect English terminology . The Narration ReviewThis audiobook was narrated by Simon Vance and he did a great job with the characters and the accents in this story . One good thing about a narration is when the narrator makes you forget that you are listening to a single person narrating a book and completely draws you in so it feels like you are listening to a group of people . Simon Vance did that . His voice was clear and his narration had good inflections . He did n't just read the story it was more like he was feeling the story and his voice reflected the feelings and emotions of the characters right to me . ** Note **I received this audiobook free from the Audio Jukebox Solid Gold Reviewer Program and HighBridge Audio in exchange for an honest review .

"A year or so ago , I was pretty much ready to give up on Nordic crime . Harry Hole was too drunken , Salander was too weird , and frankly the whole genre seemed too angst-ridden and downright miserable to be enjoyable ... and I say that as someone hardened by years of dealing with drunks and screwed-up mavericks - all fictional , of course ! At the time of my disillusionment , a fellow Amazon reviewer tried to get me to read Lckberg , promising that she was different . Finally , I 've followed that advice - and I 'm so glad I did ! Patrik Hedstrm is that rare and precious creature - a sober , likeable , intelligent detective who works within the rules and has a happy home life . And in this story he proves that that can be considerably more interesting and much more enjoyable than reading yet one more description of binge-drinking , hangovers and cowboy policing . When Patrik is called to the scene of a fatal car accident , it looks like a straightforward case of drunken driving . But the woman driver was teetotal and Patrik suspects that there may be more to the accident than meets the eye . Meantime the town has been invaded by a reality TV show starring a group of C-List celebs whose claim to fame is that they are willing to get outrageously drunk , party all night and have sex as often as they can , and all with the cameras rolling . This is problem enough , but when one of the celebs turns up dead in a bin , Patrik has two cases to deal with . So it 's lucky there 's a new member of the team - Hanna , an experienced and efficient officer has transferred to the district - especially since more deaths are on the way ... Well written , and well translated by Steven T Murray , this is an intriguing police procedural with a dark and complex plot and a satisfying conclusion . Although Patrik is the lead character , we get to know the members of his team too and their interactions add an extra layer of depth to the story . The picture Lckberg paints of contemporary Sweden is as misery-laden and angst-filled as the most ardent Nordic fan could desire , but is lightened by Patrik 's family life as he and Erica prepare for their forthcoming wedding . Although there 's clearly a running story in the background about Patrik and Erica 's relationship , this book works well as a standalone for anyone who , like me , has n't read the previous ones in the series - an omission I now intend to rectify .

"A Big Brother type reality show comes to Tanumshede bringing with it publicity , as well as problems . The producers encourage drama and conflict between the cast members for higher ratings , but now there has been a murder . The crime continues to take center stage , overshadowing the death of a local woman which at first appears to be an accident and then looks to be something more sinister . Now it\ 's up to Detective Patrik Hedstrom to get to the bottom of both cases , while still finding time for his fianc & eacute ; e and daughter . I began reading this series last year and have been looking forward to reading The Stranger for several weeks . I love this series because of the two main characters , Patrik and his fianc & eacute ; e Erica , as well as for the complex plots . The books in this series do a great job balancing the details of crime investigations with the personal life of the characters . There are also flashback scenes from the past that tie into a current crime that lend an added element of intrigue to the story . I was mesmerized by this novel from the beginning , but it\ 's not my favorite in this series . Unlike some of the prior books , I was able to piece together many parts of the mystery before the detectives . I still enjoyed the book ; both cases held my interest and I liked reading about the wedding plans Erica was making with the help of her sister Anna . However , I wish Erica would have had a more substantial part in the main story of the book . There are some great scenes between Erica and her sister , but not enough with her and her best friend Dan or between her and Patrik , but Erica is too strong of a character to be a mere subplot . I am pleased that an event at the end sets up the plot of the next book and seems to guarantee Erica will be a major part of the story . I am glad to see some of Anna\ 's problems have been resolved , but I\ 'm not sure if I like the direction the author has taken with her love life . I\ 'm curious and a little anxious to see how that changes the dynamic between the characters . Patrick does a wonderful job in the investigation by tracking down clues and in leading the other detectives while Chief Mellberg is predictably too pre-occupied with his own personal life to lead his team . While obviously incompetent as a boss , I actually feel sorry for Mellberg in this book and am curious to see what happens next for him in future installments . Most of the characters connected to the reality show are interchangeable . However , I still think their stories end a bit too abruptly . We get glimpses into their lives and their problems , but I was surprised there wasn\'t more of their reactions after the case their fellow contestant is finally solved . I would have also liked to have seen more of what Jonna will do next , but I was pleased that based on the ending , there is a chance one of the young men could be seen in future books . The Stranger was a bit more predictable than other books in the series , but also thankfully , less gory . I was a bit disappointed mostly because I have grown to love this series so much , I had higher expectations for the book . However , I still found it to be a page-turner , and I think fans of the series will enjoy the book in spite of its faults . Even though parts seem rushed , the story still captures the reader\ 's attention and doesn\'t let go . New readers who like the Scandinavian mystery/thriller genre or like to see a blend of police procedural and family life of the detectives as in novels by Cynthia Harrod-Eagles or Deborah Crombie , will like the latest by Camilla L & auml ; ckberg .

"As it is usual the case with Scandinavian crime fiction what the authors seem more interested about is talking about the local societies and their many ills than crime itself . Camilla Lckberg is one of those writers who have started becoming more and more popular in the west mainly because of her characters . Detective Patrik Hedstrm and his writer wife Erica , do not only seem to be everyday people , but also people with big hearts , who can feel the pain of the others , whose psyches are deeply scarred by the past , and who care more for justice than anything else . In The Stranger there are too many people circling around them , but also around the rural area where they live , and mostly where Patrik works : the chief of the Tanumshede police station who\ 's as lazy as they come ; a cop who lives and breathes in boredom ; another cop who\ 's finally got a lucky break ; and finally a new transfer , an ambitious woman who at some point in the future wants to become chief of police herself . And these are the people that only reside in the police station . Add to them an ambitious politician , a mysterious psychologist , the cast and the production team of a reality show , an old woman desperately in love , as well as another old woman that lives all alone in the wilderness , and you almost get the full picture . I say almost , because most of these people have a lot of secrets to hide and a lot of pain that weighs on their shoulders . Lckberg seems to be more interested in dissecting the society than giving the readers a mystery ; in making them think about everyday life , instead of trying to solve the puzzles . A road accident turns out to be a murder . Then another murder takes place that puts the city and the cops on the spotlight . And Patrik is caught in the middle of two investigations that seemingly have nothing to do with each other , even though there\ 's a chance they do . One can feel sympathy for some of the characters and their strife , but this is not an angelic world we live in , so most of them simply make him dislike them . The author seems to enjoying playing with the reader\ 's perceptions . What is good and what is evil ? Would you act any differently if you were in the perp\ 's shoes ? Can you really judge a person by his or her looks ? Can somebody escape the past unscathed ? If you are looking for an overcomplicated mystery , you\ 'll like parts of this book ; but if you\ 're searching for a novel that speaks about damaged people and the many evils of modern society you\ 'll simply love it .","book, book--parts","Positive, Positive",,

"Synopsis : A teetotaler woman is killed in a drunk driving accident . Problem is ... she was the drunk one . When more bodies start to add up , including the unpopular star of a reality star filming in town , things aren\'t adding up . Poor Patric who is trying to plan his wedding to his longtime love and mother of his daughter must now try to solve this baffling mystery with cameras rolling and the country watching . My rating : 3 StarsMy opinion : In my previous reviews regarding Ms .  Lackberg\ 's works , I have referenced the lightness and focus on emotions of her books compared to her contemporaries in Nordic Noir . I have stated that I thought that her books were too almost Americanized than the darkness and twistedness that is seen in other Nordic Noir books . I thought she was getting away from this in her book THE STONE CUTTER . However , it was back with a vengeance in this book . As a reader of heavier more twisted Nordic Noir books , I have difficulties with this , but do read her works regularly as I am frequently asked for NN recommendations .

"This book was previously published as The Gallows Bird , and I am not quite sure why they changed the title . I just know there were a lot of cranky people who bought a book they already read ! So if you have one or the other , they are the same . This is the fourth book in Lackberg\ 's Patrick Hedstrom series , which is set in a small Swedish town plagued with big city crime . The mystery plot was interesting , about a string of killings that may be the result of a serial killer , but no one is really sure , and the companion at home story line of Patrick and Erica preparing for their wedding and dealing with other family issues was also good . There are also a couple of good storylines involving some of Patrick\ 's co-workers . I don\'t know if it was the story or just that this is the fourth book I have read by this author and in this series , but I was able to figure out the twist really soon .

"This is # 4 for the Camilla Lackberg series ( also called The Stranger ) and is the lesser of her mysteries . While I enjoyed the first 3 very much , sometimes for the flashback sub-plots more than the mysteries , this one had a sub-par plot and mystery . More interesting for me in this one , and I have read the whole series , was the relationship between Patrik and Erica and family . Lackberg continues the Peyton Place like atmosphere of the small Swedish town and all of her books have something to do with parenthood , on some level , and this is no exception . She does an excellent job of setting the reader up for the next in the series , which is also good but somewhat predictable . A strong series but , for me , most of the interest comes as much from the plot lines of the characters ( her sister , the police captain , Erica & Patrik , etc . ) as it does from the mysteries . My suggestion would be to read the series in order ( The Ice Princess , the Preacher , The Stonecutter ) to enjoy them the most .","series, Lackberg, Stranger, series--plot lines, Stranger--job, Stranger--relationship between Patrik and Erica and family, first 3","Positive, Negative, Mixed, Positive, Mixed, Positive, Positive",,

"I enjoy all of the books in this series by Camilla Lckberg . I started with Ice Princess and wait for each book to be translated to English so that I can continue . Might have to learn to read Swedish ! Agree with another review that low ratings should be used with caution because they are complaining about Kindle , not the book itself . Perhaps Kindle doesn\'t work with translated books ? Don\'t know , but seems unfair to knock the book because of Kindle . Recommend this book series to everyone . I don\'t know how reading this book without reading her previous books would work . I enjoy that the author doesn\'t spend explaining characters that were introduced in previous books .

If you want to get insight on his business dealings and the restaurants in the Ramsay Holdings company and some background on his life in general then this is the book for you . However , if you want more details about the man in general , his family , his struggles over the years , then I would suggest Roasting in Hell 's Kitchen . I found Playing with Fire , interesting in the way he had to work his way up at the various restaurants . He really paid his dues , and I think by doing so , he built a foundation of what would be successful and the minimum standards he would settle for when he had his own restaurant .

"Robin Hobb has just concluded her Soldier\ 's Son trilogy with the third book -- Renegade Mage . There doesn\'t seem to be much point in reviewing solely Renegade , however , as anyone who has read the first two is likely to pick up the conclusion , so instead I\ 'll simply review the trilogy as a whole . Of course , the first question one has to answer as a reviewer is would you recommend the book ( s ) to a reader . I wish I had an answer . To be honest , I\ 'm just not sure , for several reasons . Let\ 's start with the positives . I think Hobb was truly ambitious with this series in a lot of ways , including : Character -- she is willing to have several very unlikable characters drive much of the plot -- including the one/two main character ( s )  . Point of view -- employing a hybrid first/third person limited in Renegade Magic when the main character is an observer in his own body . Themes -- the clash of cultures , the clash of religions , free will , prejudice , environmentalism , the individual versus the greater good , progress versus tradition , etc . She wrestles with big questions here and often does so thoughtfully and eloquently . World creation -- setting her trilogy in a 17-1800\ 's American frontier sort of world with no truly strange races ( and none of the clichd ones -- elves , dwarves , etc ) , no bizarre or portentous sounding place names , and very little wielded magic ( usually the magic does the wielding )  . Gray ethics -- presenting us with characters and situations where the choices are not so black and white , where actions aren\'t obviously good or evil . Plot and pace -- carrying us along in a slow , almost real-time/real life pace and pulling tension out of character or economics/politics rather than out of battle and conquest . In short , she breaks away forcefully from many of the conventions of the fantasy epic genre -- the medieval , magic-infused , mixed-race world where armies mass for large battles while a small overmatched group representing the obvious good quests for a sneaky way to defeat obvious evil , led of course by the Dread Lord Sauron , I mean , um . . . The complete originality that permeates the book is a welcome change of pace from the usual big-book fantasy . Another plus is simply the writing . Whether she is creating an entire continent or the smaller worlds of home and barracks , township or market ; or creating major characters that spill across all three novels or minor ones that appear for only a few paragraphs or pages , she does so with a sharp , rich sense of fine detail . Her dialogue is rock solid -- sounding like people would actually sound during the situations they find themselves in . Clearly , then , there is a lot to admire in Soldier\ 's Son . But that\ 's also the sticking point . There is a lot to admire , but if I were completely honest , I\ 'm not sure there is a lot to enjoy . It\ 's an admirable risk to employ an unlikable character , let alone several , but it\ 's a risk that may work better in novella form , or at least in a single novel . It\ 's asking a lot , perhaps too much , of a reader , to carry that dislike over 2000 pages . I could barely do it , finding the main character Nevarre almost too much to continue with in book two and here again in book three . When he gets twinned with an equally unlikable other self , and the two of them do little but squabble or sulk , it became almost enough to make me stop even in the concluding book of a series . Hobb wrestles with big themes here , but I\ 'm not sure I walked away with a crystalline view of how we\ 're supposed to see them . Looking over the series , it seemed many of the concepts were a bit muddy . If you\ 're just throwing them out there for us to think about ( talk amongst yourselves ) , that\ 's fine , but somehow I feel a bit more is warranted if I\ 'm going to invest the time to read three large books . The point of view is interesting stylistically , but I\ 'm not sure it best served the book . The passivity of the narrator was a bit annoying , and his ability/inability to become active seemed a bit too arbitrary , based more on the need of plot than anything else . The pace is sometimes too slow in all three books . Book one rewards the pace more than either of the latter two books , which seem overly slow , overly dry , and at times overly repetitive -- both could have lost a few hundred pages and suffered very little in terms of characterization or plot . While the endings of books one and two do much to redeem their earlier flaws , and though some of Renegade Mage\ 's ending has the same effect , much of it also seems too pat , too forced , or tacked on . And the big solution to the whole clash of cultures , or at least a major one , seems far too simple and anti-climactic , making one wonder if the whole thing couldn\'t have been solved in the first thirty pages of book one . In the end , I\ 'm torn about recommending the series . After all , for most people 2000 pages is a large investment of time . I\ 'm a fast reader and all three books probably took me about 10 days total to read and I\ 'm still not sure I feel it was worth it . I\ 'm still trying to decide . But if someone needs to set aside 20-30 days of reading , or more , than it\ 's hard to imagine that they\ 'll feel repaid in the end . And with so much out there that is both rich and enjoyable , it\ 's hard not to send them elsewhere . Which would be sad , because as I said , there\ 's a lot to admire and this sort of ambition should be rewarded I think . But not if it doesn\'t equally reward the reader . So I\ 'll cheat a little and say read book one . In many ways , and especially many traditional ways -- it\ 's the book most likely to bring enjoyment . If that one doesn\'t do it for you , and doesn\'t do it by a lot , then don\'t feel bad about putting it down and picking up something else . But if you can find reward in its rich character and slow , measured pace , then give the next book a shot . I wish I could be more effusive than that , but it\ 's the best I can do .","latter two books, main character Nevarre, book--narrator, three books--pace, book, Book one--pace, book--writing, book--big solution, book--complete originality, book--point of view, it","Negative, Negative, Negative, Mixed, Mixed, Mixed, Positive, Negative, Positive, Mixed, Negative",,

"My feelings on this book are quite similar to my feelings to the last two . The entire series is decent ; I did n't feel like I wasted my time reading it but neither did I feel hugely impacted by what I 'd read . The mark of a good series , whether fantasy or not , is whether you feel changed when you come to the end of the story . Has it made any difference in you as the reader ? Do you ache and rejoice with the characters for the sadness or happiness at the end ? I did none of those after reading this book . I simply put it down and selected what to read next . None of this to stay that the story was n't good , it just was n't exceptional . Being an avid reader of fantasy , I 'm fairly familiar with the whole 'and they lived happily ever after ' story line . It grates on me that so many writers do n't accept the reality that the hero does n't always win , and even if he does he does n't always end up with the girl he loves living happily ever after . In previous books , Hobb has n't seemed to subscribe to the camp of fantasy writers but this book takes that idea completely . It stretches the credibility of everything working out in the end . Not only does Nevare become handsome ( thin ) again but every sundered relationship is seemingly repaired with little trouble . I feel that Hobb was experimenting some in this book by the issues she dealt with as well as the story line and I do n't feel like it was hugely successful . I saw a lot of ways that the story could n't have been better if it had clung more to reality and less to wishful thinking . I did , however , like the look at the Speck culture because for the most part it was a foreign culture with different views and beliefs that she brought to life . But during a pivotal point in the book when the son of Nevare/Soldier Boy 's keeper is taken away they revert to what you would expect of any culture . This was a weakness in the story because she had constantly been pointing out that the Specks were not like the humans in how they dealt with each other and especially with their children . I 've said it throughout my reviews of this series but in the end it was a decent read but nothing spectacular .

"This book should never have been written , the Soldier 's son trilogy has enough repetition to have been two books . Then it may have worked . This really is not worth the effort , the Frontier feminism , and the Speck culture are interesting , but slight . It is the lead character who is simply not plausible , even in a magic infused world . He reminded me a little of Fitz from the Tawny man / Farseer trilogies . They are both burdened with powers that they are not skilled in , they both get tossed around by circumstance and are continually punished for being unceasingly loyal . However , Fitz had well fleshed out , colorful friends and did n't simply wander around passively . The indignities and suffering heaped on poor Nevare are legion , and as such get simply tedious .

"Robin Hobb 's SOLDIER SON TRILOGY is a series I highly recommend , even though I had a love/hate relationship going with the series all the way through . Hobb takes you boldly where other authors have feared to go and has done so admirably . This is not your typical always conquering and succeeding hero triumph over all work , instead your hero seems to fail more often than succeed . I found myself frustrated when things did n't turn out as expected , yet I discovered that I was spellbound by the story line and starved to see what would happen next . It was not until I was 2/3 through the second book in the series that I realized the true genius of Hobb 's writing style and story lines . It 's sort of like eating peach pie when you were anticipating cherry , something different but still mighty tasty . By the time I had finished the series I was hooked as a Robin Hobb fan and find myself buying all of her works I can find .

"I love Robin Hobb , her Assassin series is supreme . However Solgiers Son trilogy is really bellow par . To start with it is about a really confused character ruminating all the time on this and that and the other thing . It also constantly tries to make some sort of shallow moral battles between two worlds . Honestly it failed in both . And the way it finishes simply does not make sense . After building all this complicated feudal world with tones of social rules just imagine what happens ! The main character gets invited to return home and become the Lord 's heir . And now please tell me how he can do so with his common law wife who has 3 kids from some pickpocket , who is a commoner and on top of that has the reputation of a whore ?

"I had given the first and second installments of this series four stars . I had wondered why there were so many negative reviews . I found the first two books nicely paced and nicely told . Then comes the third and final installment of the Solder Son Trilogy , Renegade 's Magic . I simply ca n't defend this book at all . It lost me almost from the beginning . I was shocked chapter after chapter when this book just did n't take hold . The split personality thing was so annoying and I was astounded that it lasted so long . It just did n't work for me . The world building for this book just could n't hold up the more things were revealed , especially the Speck Culture and mysterious trading partners . I have to say that Robin Hobb is a very workmanlike author . She delivers thick series that are properly told . For me , with this last book , it just really sours the whole seris . It was really boring . I was skimming through pages time after time . Honestly I probably only reaed 3/4ths of this book so perhaps I 'm unqualified to rewiew , but it was n't that I did n't read the end . I just skimmed by things that were completely uninteresting and predictable to me . I think that if I were to give reviews now on all three books I would probably have changed my first two reviews to three stars instead of four . This series had potential and drive . It just had no wings , and no roots to take off or take hold .","first two books, series, second, installments of this, series--Robin Hobb","Positive, Mixed, Positive, Positive, Positive",,
"Seriously , something 's wrong when you 're rooting for the protagonist to drop gloriously dead throughout the series . Why oh why could n't the whole thing have been about Epiny ? I would 've enjoyed that ... Renegade 's Magic , book III in the Soldier Son Trilogy , unfortunately does n't solve many of the problems of the first two installments ( i . e . slow pacing and a useless main character ) . It does n't , however , introduce any new issues either . Hobb is still an excellent writer . Her prose never fails to transport me into whatever world she 's writing about , her dialogue is fantastic , and her characterization , always a strong suit for her , is just as immaculate as anyone experienced with her work would expect . All of these things the book has going for it . But oh , Nevare , Nevare ... Hobb generally manages to include at least one good male character , from Captain Kennit in Liveship Traders to Fitz in the Assassin books . Okay , as time has gone on , her female characters generally tend to outshine them , but they 've still remained at least readable ... up until now . Nevare Burvelle is a bland , whiny , uncharismatic moron . He sighs , sobs , and whimpers his way through three novels , maddeningly unwilling to act on or even recognize what the reader sees to be obvious . He 's everything that Fitz was threatening to become in Tawny Man , and while , this being Hobb , it 's not actively bad ... it 's inescapably just boring . Irritatingly , the reason for Nevare 's faults is generally the same as the reason for Fitz 's in Tawny Man ... and , actually , it 's even hinted at being the reason for a few of Kennit 's in Liveship Traders . So ... may I just take this opportunity to say ... ENOUGH with the split souls already , Ms .  Hobb . It was an interesting experiment the first time around , and I was actually very impressed by how you managed to eliminate certain characteristics from your protagonist . But I found it very hard to keep reading about a protagonist I not only did n't admire but actively disliked . There 's only so far the godliness of the debut trilogy can keep us reading before we all just get fed up . If we MUST continue to see the soul-cut-in-half trope recur , can the hero of the next one at least end up getting the extroverted and action-oriented tendencies for once ? I think that 's really it : it 's rare that my opinion of a book is as simple as this , but it really is a simple divide this time . I love the world , I love the supporting characters , I love the idea , and I adore Hobb 's prose . But I simply can not find it in myself to like the protagonist . Call me shallow , but when I read a trilogy of books , I generally want at the very least a character I can endure , at best a character I admire in some way . Nevare is impossible to admire in almost any respect , intentionally constructed that way . And while I can admire the craft and artistry put into creating such a protagonist , while I can appreciate what Hobb has done with the elements of characterization , I still ca n't figure out WHY she had to do this not once , not twice , but THREE TIMES . Arguably , Kennit does n't deserve the same severity as the rest of them , so let 's exclude him . Still ... she 's DONE THIS BEFORE . WHY do it again ? I ca n't figure that out . Creating an unlikable lead is an interesting idea , but it 's basically an ego project , done simply to show off her skill and cleverness more than to give the reader a good time . Maybe I 'm old-fashioned , but I just think that 's a little backwards .","prose, book III in the Soldier Son Trilogy--Hobb, prose--dialogue, book III in the Soldier Son Trilogy--protagonist, Nevare, prose--characterization, female characters, book III in the Soldier Son Trilogy","Positive, Positive, Positive, Mixed, Negative, Positive, Negative, Mixed",,
"I enjoyed the books . The following review is largely a quick comparison between the Assassin books and Soldier Son . Yes , Nevare is a different character from Fitz , but he is very well drawn out and consistent throughout . And you know what , I would n't want the repetition of the same character ! The plot itself was very imaginative . There were several parallels with the Fitz stories and the turns of events were a little more predictable , but that did not spoil the story at all . I thought these books were a great deal lighter than Hobb 's previous works .

"This was n't my favorite series by Hobb , but I surely applaud the endeavor . Renegade 's Magic was n't , to my mind , the best conclusion to any of her trilogies . This was largely because Nevare 's inability to choose persisted well past the point of irrational and into the landscape of unrealistic . I wanted to shake him more than any other fantasy character since the Unbeliever . This flaw made the book feel very very very very long . Still , Hobb was working with some big issues here -- and I 'm always delighted to see an author leave their comfortable territory . I really liked that she tried not to romanticize either side in the cultural conflict ; she handled the major themes with her typical skill and grace . As always , looking forward to the next .","next, book, book--author, Nevare, series by","Positive, Mixed, Positive, Negative, Positive",,

I had difficulty liking Nevarre from the first book , but could sort of forgive it in the sense that I decided I was n't supposed to like him , because a part of him ( the part with an actual spine ) was missing . The last third or so of the book was entertaining , definitely . The first two thirds can be skipped with almost no problem whatsoever , because they consist almost exclusively of what food Nevarre is eating and what it tastes like . The entire plot with Orandula was pointless . It added nothing , except was the author 's excuse to have a very unrealistic happy ending . The book should have ended about 3/4 of the way through , with what would have been a decent , if not 100 % happy ending . It would have been satisfying . Overall , it was pretty implausible . I really liked her Liveship books . This was nothing like those , and the Farseer books seem more similar to these than to the Liveship books , so I may have to consider that I just do n't actually like Robin Hobb as much as I 'd initially thought .","book, book--last third, trilogy, book--first two thirds, book--Nevarre, book--ending, Liveship books","Mixed, Positive, Negative, Negative, Negative, Negative, Positive",,

"Forest Mage finishes up the Soldier Son trilogy and was on par with the other two books . All three books were paced the same and this third book felt no different or raised anymore excitement than the other two . It was a satisfying book , and I enjoyed it . The character development as usual was top notch , but the world building in this final story was almost extinct . The plot wasn\'t the most exciting or challenging that I\ 've read , but nevertheless it was acceptable . I know this is Robin Hobb\ 's least liked series , but I would still recommend the book and series . I got a lot of enjoyment out of the books , felt a strong attachment with Navare and sympathized with both races : the Specks and the Gernains . The third book wraps up Nevare\ 's plight between the Specks and the Gernains . Nevrare now has been taken over by his split self Soldier Boy and Soldier Boy has no love for the Gernains , and plans to destroy the town of Getty\ 's to save the spirit trees of the specks . Nevare is now trapped and can\'t control Soldier Boy and must follow along even though he does not want to destroy his own people and friends . The whole book pretty much is the story of two different aspects of one person sharing the same body , and the conflict that is occurring in both parts . The conclusion raps up very nicely , in fact maybe a little bit too nicely as everything comes to a happy ending . But I guess that\ 's what I wanted all along . I give the book a thumbs up !","book, third book, book--world building, book--character development, books","Mixed, Positive, Positive, Positive, Positive",,
"Nevare gives himself over to the Speck magic , and this book is spent mostly under the influence of his other half Soldier\ 's Boy while the Nevare half of his soul is pushed around and silenced . This makes for a confusing , frustrating read as pages upon pages are written between the spiritual struggle of the two halves without anything really interesting happening . We are given insight into the Speck world and their Great Ones , hugely fat sorcerers that do nothing but eat and have feeders so that they eat the stuff that makes them the fattest ( and thus getting fat with magic ) . The fatter the sorcerer , the more powerful and Nevare/Soldier\ 's Boy is determined to be the fattest of all so he can somehow save both his human people and the Specks . The whole thing reads like a primitive food lover\ 's guide as they stuff themselves with every kind of mushroom and fantasy fruit imaginable . The Great Ones are like giant human slugs ( Jabba the Hut , yes ) . Of course near the end he manages to break free from his turmoil and perhaps save some of the people he cares about . Why can\'t the Specks see him near the end ( they can see other humans , magic or no magic ) ? Why did Lisana make that last grab for eternity with Nevare when she already had a piece of him already ? ( this was really at odds with her personality in the book )  . Confusing and just plain awful to read . Would not call this an epic by any stretch of the imagination .",book,Negative,,
"I loved Shaman 's Crossing and thought Forest Mage was okay , but Renegade 's Magic was just too much . The narrative point-of-view is probably the biggest problem here . Again , we have first-person from Nevare 's perspective -- the problem is , Nevare 's alter ego takes over his body , and he spends most of the 700-page book as an observer . At this point , I 've had it with Nevare 's impotence . I do n't require incredibly decisive protagonists ( thought he was great in book one , when he was relatable ) , but when they lack free will and literally can not control their own actions , it bothers me . There are a number of ways the author could have made this trilogy more palatable : for instance ( 1 ) by writing it in the third person , using 3-4 POV characters , ( 2 ) by using a different narrator for each book and having Nevare narrate only # 1 or ( 3 ) by letting Nevare become an army officer and come to similar situations of his own free will . Hobb does none of these , so the reading becomes increasingly frustrating . Like Forest Mage , Renegade 's Magic comes in around 700 pages long and probably should have been 150 pages or so shorter . In earlier books the plot might have been slow but was always moving ; here we get a dozen appearances by Orandula where one would do . Dialogue started to bother me here as well , as it has little in common with the way real people talk . ( I ca n't say whether this was a problem throughout the trilogy or just here , but it only bothered me here . This and a couple other issues make me wonder if the editing was a rush job on this one . ) Worse , interesting and important plot events happen in Nevare 's absence . There 's barely a climax -- certainly nothing worthy of 2000 pages ' reading -- and the resolution was unsatisfying . Plus , there are some key continuity errors . For instance , Epiny has a brother . His name is Hotorn . The author seems to have forgotten his existence , along with that of Nevare 's younger brother . There are still things to like here : we see more of the world and especially the Speck culture , which is fascinating , as are many of the supporting characters . There is also a handful of very well-written and memorable moments . I wish that certain supporting characters played larger roles , though ; in a book that plumbs so deeply into the psyches and relationships of the characters , it 's not good to be left wondering why certain characters ( Nevare and Epiny , Nevare and Amzil ) care about each other so much . And using only Nevare 's perspective while he spends most of the book with the Specks means key supporting characters like Yaril never appear at all , while others have minimal screen time . I still recommend Shaman 's Crossing , but can not recommend reading further in the trilogy .","Forest Mage--narrative point-of-view, Shaman 's Crossing, book, Forest Mage--protagonists, trilogy, book--Hobb, book--editing, book--moments, book--Dialogue","Negative, Positive, Mixed, Negative, Negative, Negative, Negative, Positive, Negative",,
"I must say that Robin Hobb finished up this trilogy stronger than I thought she would . Forgive me for being a sucker for an ending of coincidence . The strange thing is that very little of this book is done by , essentially , good ol ' Nevarre . The setting of this book finally delves strongly into the hidden society of the Speck people . The story is one of the natural world and the reasons its people love it so . It 's kind of odd to see a fantasy of quite this tree-hugging nature , but it works . The ending may strike some as odd or too convenient , but I found myself smiling at its quirkiness ( as well as being satisfied )  .

"Book Two moved in such a painfully slow circle , I almost skipped this last book . But I 'm glad that I plodded onward , because it has some good moments and offered a very satisfying conclusion . This is the ninth Robin Hobb book I have read . She 's especially good at world-building and creating multi-faceted characters . Her weakness , I 'm afraid , is pacing , and this trilogy definitely suffers from a sluggish pace . Information is repeated multiple times , the characters have the same arguments over and over , and every other page is a list of what Nevare eats . Looking back , I realize that her other trilogies also suffered from repetitive scenes and conversations ( how many times did Chade made herb tea ? ) , but I did n't mind as much because the characters were so likeable and the plot so interesting . In this series , the characters are less likeable ( the protag was downright boring in Book Two ) and the plot plays one annoying note over and over again ( save the trees ! ) . So overall . . . this is not Robin Hobb 's best work . . . but worth reading if you do n't mind a slow pace and endless descriptions of strange menu items . I still give it four stars because Robin Hobb is a very gifted writer . Her writing style is very easy to read and I 'm always pulled into it .

"Like many reviewers on here I did enjoy the first two books of this series despite their unnecessary length and slow pacing . I disliked Nevare and his constant blunders and inability to learn and grow from them . Often times Nevare would get into trouble ( deserving or not ) , wiggle out of it , and then turn around and do the same thing again to get in trouble . It was kind of maddening . However , the concept of the books was interesting , the sole perspective made it unique while being also annoying ( single perspective meant that every time some back story was needed readers are basically given a long lecture or narrative in the form of a letter or boring conversation . ) , and there was just something that kept drawing me back to the story more than many other fantasy novels . I truly wanted to see how this series would end . Unfortunately this book was a massive disappointment to me . Easily the worst of the 3 and in my mind so bad that I probably would move to not even recommend the series to anyone . Sad really because Shaman 's Crossing did have many enjoyable moments and Forest Mage also did well . It seems as though Hobb took all of the unpleasant elements of the first two novels and just loaded up on them . In the final installment we find Nevare as annoying as ever , still immature and crabby BUT now he has lost control of his body . This makes for a unique reader perspective but it just becomes so labor intensive I found it more of a distraction . The 3rd installment introduces a ton of new characters , all of whom are unlikeable . Most of the previous characters from the set up books are mostly ignored except for some of Nevare 's rambling dream sequences . In fact most of the 3rd book is basically Nevare walking around the woods with a bunch of annoying people eating and whining about things . And seriously how many times can this guy die or try and kill himself ? It was a real disappointment because I invested quite a bit of time into this series with high hopes it would all be worth it . Instead Robin delivered more of the worst and very little of value . I am suspect that Hobb can write men at this point . Nevare ( and other men in the series ) really do not think or act like men . I would know as I am one . I found myself having to constantly remind myself of how old Nevare actually was because based on his maturity I would not wager he was older than a 13 year old girl . Finally the ending , the payoff , what I had waded through 600+ pages of junk and 2000 total for . What a waste . The SS trilogy always read slow and methodically with every bit of tension building over long periods of time for a dramatic event yet the final conclusion wraps up so quickly it seemed she either got bored of the series or missed her deadline . The final chapters are completely out of character from the base material of the series . Plus it was way too fairytale for my liking especially considering the dark and brutal nature of the first 2 novels . I was really hoping this series could be something I could have been real proud of and something I could recommend to my friends . Heck I really WANTED to like this book . But it was really awful . As others said it could have been 300 pages and still been too long . It was too boring , filled with too many unlikeable and pointless characters , and had a complete cop out ending . If you have read the 1st two novels be prepared to be disappointed with this novel . Heck you may want to just stop now and imagine your own ending for the series . It probably will be better than this . If you have not read this series I must now advise you stay away .

"This is the third and final volume in the Soldier Son trilogy ( after Shaman\ 's Crossing and Forest Mage )  . Barely escaping Gettys and its angry mob with his life , Nevare flees into the forest . Realizing that the King\ 's Road is planned to go right through the part where Lisana\ 's tree stands , he makes one last attempt at stopping its construction with the Magic . Alas , it doesn\'t work as expected and Nevare\ 's Magic is all be depleted . Finding him in this poor condition , Olikea and her son Likari need to feed him again until he regains a respectable girth , so they can present him as Great One to their kin clan at the Wintering Place , on the other side of the Barrier Mountains . As time passes and Nevare tries to find out what the Magic expects him to do , his Speck self , Soldier\ 's Boy , becomes more and more powerful , until he finally takes control of his body . Nevare is then nothing but a helpless witness of Soldier\ 's Boy\ 's actions : when he tattoos his skin with the dapples of the Specks , or when he plans a raid on the Gernians in Gettys to stop their Eastward progression . Only on rare occasions can Nevare surreptitiously tap Soldier\ 's Boy Magic and dream-walk to his cousin Epiny , to try and warn her of the impending attack . A major part of the book takes place in the forest with the Specks , and even though I\ 'm a tree-hugger , sadly I must admit that their culture failed to intrigue me . I felt close to Nevare but not to Soldier\ 's Boy . Probably because the Gernian-bred me was taking sides , and I found myself constantly waiting for signs that things would look up for Nevare , that the scales would finally tip in his favour and reunite his split personality without too much loss and sacrifice .

"I hate to sound repetitive but I find my thoughts about this series moving in sync with other reviewers . I feel Robin Hobb is just about the best person writing complex epic fantasy these days , and her stories are chock full of original ideas or if not wholly original , used in new and different ways . This series is certainly that way . But it was not an easy read . Her main character is not someone I enjoyed spending a lot of time with -- at times he came across as unnecessarily dense to me -- but her portrayal of him was compelling and interesting and I wanted to find out what happened . I did feel the promise of the first book was n't fully realized in the last two , and it was a challenge to stick with the second book . Depressing is the word for it . But Hobb 's writing pulls you along and just when I think I 've had enough ( her pacing is snail-like ) something happens that would grab my interest and keep me reading . The third book was more satisfying , though as others have said there are long , long passages where the hero is passive and having things done to him rather than being an active character . The ending pretty much redeemed the series for me . I have to say I found her approach to magic very powerful but for me , not wholly thought through . Part of the problem with the series is that everyone is a victim of the magic . I 'm happy not to have all-powerful wizards who use magic like a tool ; having a magic that uses you as well is refreshing , but I felt she could have gone a little further in describing where it comes from and the rationale behind it -- and I would have been happier with a magic you can partner with . As it is , the magic is all powerful and impersonal , though apparently the gods ( who annoyingly intervene now and again in ways that create a deus ex machina feel to the plot ) are immune to it . So what is it ? A natural force ? It 's never really explained . But because of the way it acts , no one is really responsible for anything they do since everyone is basically a tool in the hands of an impersonal force . The moral issues the hero and others grapple with in the end are meaningless because at every key point they are forced to act by the magic . And at a climatic scene , those you had been led to feel might be allies turn into villains in a way that did n't make sense to me and did n't seem true to what had gone before . Still , it was an exciting scene ! But that 's a quibble . Would I recommend the series ? Yes , but only to folks willing to give it the patience needed . Robin Hobbs tackles some large themes , and I particularly enjoyed her exploration of the conflict between development and progress and the integrity of the natural world and the needs of the environment . I felt rewarded by having read it . It 's a flawed work , but it 's still better and more thoughtful than just about anything else out there at the moment that I 've read . A challenging series but worth the read .","second book--Robin Hobbs, 's writing, series--main character, third book, series--Robin Hobbs, second book, series, series--exploration, third book--ending","Positive, Positive, Negative, Positive, Positive, Mixed, Mixed, Positive, Positive",,
"Robin Hobb , Renegade\ 's Magic ( Eos , 2008 ) Note : this review necessarily contains spoilers for the first two books in the series . If you have not yet started the series and are planning on reading it , skip this review . Someday , I fantasize , Robin Hobb will write a main character who learns from his mistakes . That day has not yet come . But I hope it will someday . Here , we have Nevare Burvelle , a character who has had it drilled into him that the Speck magic which has claimed him finds a way to get its revenge every time he tries to use it for his own ends . And yet , what does he do in the opening pages of this book ? You guessed it . The story picks up just after we left it in Forest Mage , with Nevare having faked his own death and fleeing to the protection of the Speck , who have recognized him as a great one . Jodoli , and others , have seen in dreams that Nevare is the one who will finally find a way to drive the Gernians away from the Speck forever , but neither the other Great Ones nor Nevare himself ( nor Nevare\ 's alter ego , Soldier\ 's Boy , who has one again awakened and is attempting to assert his dominance over Nevare ) is sure how this is going to happen . It eventually dawns on Nevare -- and , soon after , Soldier\ 's Boy -- that in order for the magic to fully use him , Nevare will have to become whole , rejoining himself with Soldier\ 's Boy to form a complete human being -- the one thing Nevare most dreads . And , just to make matters interesting , Orandula , the old god of death , has decided to take an interest in the proceedings thanks to a seemingly minor act Nevare committed way back when . As usual , getting lost in Hobb\ 's writing is a simple task , no matter the subject to which she turns her hand . This is a good thing , because when it comes right down to it , Renegade\ 's Magic is kind of flimsy . I can\'t say why this is without going into major , major spoilers for the book ; let\ 's just say the climax ( which comes a good hundred pages before the end ; I think , and I rejoice if it\ 's true , Hobb is setting us up for another go-round with these folks , the same as she did with the ending of the Farseer Trilogy ) is a long time coming and a bit of , well , an anticlimax . We could see it coming from a mile away ( and a year away ; it\ 's pretty obvious what needs to happen even in Forest Mage ) . It is , however , testament to some excellent planning that Hobb executes the climax in the way she does ; she\ 's obviously been writing toward this moment since the very first words of this trilogy , and she weaves a number of disparate and seemingly meaningless clues into her solution to this whole mess . She also sets up some interesting alternatives and gives us a first look at the folk from over the salt water , as the Speck call them ( who , I am still convinced , come from Bingtown ... ) , which add a bit more meat to my idea that she\ 's not yet done with Nevare and his merry band . The disappointment over the climax is faint , however , because of how well it works . This book is definitely a triumph of style over substance ; it\ 's good not necessarily because of what it is , but because Robin Hobb wrote it . Nevare has been driving me nuts this whole trilogy , just as FitzChivalry Farseer did before him , but it matters little ; I\ 'll keep coming back to Robin Hobb because she can write up a storm . ****","book--planning, book--Robin Hobb, book","Positive, Positive, Positive",,
"I\ 'm not sure how anyone who has read Robin Hobb\ 's prior books , not just this trilogy but the three others she\ 's written , can read this book and say it disapoints and isn\'t as good as the others . I mean OK folks can certainly have their opinion but to me this books is just as good as the other books in the Soldiars Son trilogy and on equal footing with her other trilogy finale books . What I truly enjoy about her characters is that they become so real for me , they aren\'t 100 % good or bad and they are always ruled by events and the stuff that life throws at them and are ultimately just as fallible as we real world humans are . I love that , it is her style and the tone she has used from the very fist book she wrote ; Assasin\ 's Aprentice . ( Well as Robin Hobb anyway . ) I enjoyed this book completely I enjoyed the trials Nevarre went through I was sad , angry , and happy at all the times the author was hoping I would be . Just as with her other books I wanted more . And there is some thing sooo gratifying about her endings ... even if they don\'t always end 100 % happy , they still have a good wrapped up quality so that you pretty much know , while there could be more to the story , you can stop reading without any burning questions of : what about this ? I look forward to her next books , I don\'t buy many hard backs but her books have become one of the my must haves !","book--characters, next books, book--trials, book, that","Positive, Positive, Positive, Positive, Positive",,

I would not recommend this book to anyone .","third book, first two books, third book--story","Negative, Positive, Negative",,
"Like many who have reviewed this book , I 'm a huge Robin Hobb fan , having read almost everything she 's published . This , by far , is the least-inspiring series of the bunch . For those who have read the Farseer trilogies , Nevare will come off as a flimsy carbon copy of Fitz : a conflicted , sometimes thick-headed , often goofy , but always heroic protagonist . Nevare is basically the same guy in a different outfit . In the first book of the Soldier Son series I was excited about the world Hobb was creating , and I always love the creative lengths she goes to describe the landscapes that her characters travel through ( she 's especially good at describing forests ! ) . But there was something just ... plodding and slow about this book . Not a lot happened and too much time was spent with Nevare having internal battles . And what should have been a clever plot device with Soldier 's Son and Nevare just wound up being clumsy and annoying to read , and really not that interesting . I wound up wishing one of them would just die so I would n't have to listen to the incessant bickering anymore . I would n't recommend this book to a first-time Hobb reader . A dedicated fan might enjoy it on a cursory level , but I 'll hold out hopes that her next series has a lot more to offer .","book--one of them, book, Nevare, book--world, book--Hobb","Negative, Mixed, Negative, Positive, Positive",,

"Normally I devour Robin Hobb\ 's books in one day . I get sucked into the story , and don\'t want to put the book down until I\ 'm finished . This was not the case with this novel . The first 2/3 of the book is slow going . If it had been the first book of series , I would\ 've quit reading it . However , I had already invested lots of time in the series , so I wanted to see it through the typical Hobbs-style bitter end . I am glad I did , but the ending made it all worth while . ***Slight Spoiler Alert***For once , the Hero gets what he deserves in the end . After torturing poor Nevare throughout the second book in the trilogy and most of this one , he finally gets a happy ending . I was so thrilled at the ending , that I could not quit talking about it to my friends . It is now a week since I finished the book , and I\ 'm still on a bit of a high from the happy ending . I know , I\ 'm strange , I can\'t help it . ***End Slight Spoiler***For a wrap up , I am giving this book 4 stars because no matter how happy I was with the ending , the slow pace of the first 2/3 of the book destroys any hope of 5 star rating . For those people thinking about skipping the finale of the series , I say go ahead and read it .

"Robin Hobbs is surpassing Samuel Donaldson in writing about characters that do nothing but agonize and do n't do anything . I suffered through 9 books of S Donaldson , but enjoyed the first 3 or 4 of Hobbs ' apprentice series ( all 6 ) although the more she wrote , the slower things went . the last two were agonizing for me . It took so long for something to happen , and you wanted to shake the characters and tell them to suck it up and do something . The first in these three was interesting , compelling , and worth reading . The second and this one are infuriating .

I think when it came to all the description about the food that the Great One 's must eat we could have done with much less . I understand its importance but there was just too much of it . Ms .  Hobb did a great job creating a connection to the characters for me and to be honest that is the only reason that I made it through this book .

"The conclusion to Robin Hobb\ 's Soldier Son trilogy , Renegade\ 's Magic , is much like the first two books in the series . This has to be one of the most slow-moving , in-depth character and fantasy-setting studies that I have ever read . I greatly enjoyed the first two books ( Shaman\ 's Crossing and Forest Mage ) , but as the pace remained glacial , my love for the series waned a bit . Once again , I love Hobb\ 's characterization skills but it was almost a chore to get through this book . Not a good way to end a series , but still not bad . Hobb has created a wonderfully detailed society in the Specks , and she spends a lot of time in Renegade\ 's Magic exploring it as Navarre and Soldier\ 's Boy try to come to terms with what\ 's become of them . This book , as is the rest of the series , is told in first person by Navarre , but for much of the book Navarre is a disembodied presence in Soldier\ 's Boy\ 's body . Thus , we get many passages of Navarre being horrified by what Soldier\ 's Boy is doing with his body , of Navarre trying to either take control of the body or of him trying to influence Soldier\ 's Boy\ 's thinking . Narratively , I\ 'm sure there\ 's a reason for it , but occasionally it becomes obvious that Hobb needed time to pass quickly so she has Soldier\ 's Boy cause Navarre to disappear for a while . Since we see through Navarre\ 's eyes , we don\'t see anything until he wakes up again . I did greatly appreciate the depth that Hobb brings to Navarre and to Soldier\ 's Boy as well , the latter of which is even more impressive given the fact that we only see him through Navarre\ 's eyes . Yes , one could say that this entire series is a 2000+ page character study of Navarre , in addition to a fantasy examination of the struggles between nature and science/technology , but the character study is the most interesting part . Hobb\ 's characterization skills come to the fore once again , and my interest in Navarre is what kept me going through some of the slower passages . Sadly , the climax of the book brings the societal conflict to a close in an almost paint-by-numbers format . When Nevarre finally realizes what he has to do , he quickly goes about doing it and in the process uncovers some of the nuggets Hobb buried in the previous book in order to make the ending even more convenient . The tension between the two societies was delicious , as well as the struggle by the Specks to find some way to combat the building of the road . It\ 's just too bad most of the book feels like Navarre and Soldier\ 's Boy pounding their heads against the wall until suddenly everything becomes clear . Renegade\ 's Magic , and consequently the rest of the Soldier\ 's Son series , isn\'t for everybody . Some will find the slow pace extremely annoying and will put the first book down long before getting into the story . If the thought of this kind of story repels you , I would think you would have to be a big Hobb fan in order to enjoy it . It even battered me down at times , with the books getting increasingly harder to get through . I still think they are worth the journey , though , and Renegade\ 's Magic is a fitting conclusion to everything that came before . It\ 's an interesting experiment , and while I\ 'm not sure I want to read something like this again too soon , I don\'t feel my time has been wasted .

"Once again , Robin Hobb proves she\ 's the best fantasy writer out today . Her books are extremely well-written . Her characters are real and the plot never moves in the direction you think it will go . Most important , unlike many bigger named fantasy authors today , she actually ends her books . Wow , what a concept ! ! Renegade\ 's Magic has a fantastic ending , one that doesn\'t end in climactic battles , earth shattering revelations , or the destruction of the Greatest Evil Ever to Walk the Universe . It ends with a thought , with a whisper , with a suggestion of promise that inspires you to want to read more , but you know you shouldn\'t . The story is over . I love Robin Hobb for her well-written simplicity . She doesn\'t make her worlds into large scale epics . She doesn\'t introduce 20 characters a book , and expect you to keep up with all of it . She has a limited number of characters , but they\ 're all very well created . You get to know them very well in a short period of time . And , they are all different ! They\ 're like real people , not the usual fantasy world characters . They have feelings , problems and they make mistakes . Lots of them . Not major mistakes that cause the world to end or the plot to fall apart , but small ones , normal mistakes that normal people would make when confronted in a stressful , unfamiliar situation . This is what separates her from the rest . A refreshing realism , combined with excellent writing . No plot spoilers or descriptions in this review . If you haven\'t read the other two , then I suggest you do . When you\ 're finished , keep reading . Start with the first Farseer Trilogy and move onto the Liveship Traders series , still in my opinion , her best work .

"I have profound respect for Robin Hobb as a writer . And she really went out on a limb with this book , indeed with the entire trilogy . I\ 'm sorry to say that , for me , that limb cracked about half way through , and it all came crashing to the slimy , mud covered , insert riddled ground . I don\'t read fantasy for any other reason than enjoyment . I need a break . I grab a book . This doesn\'t mean that the books have to be mindless or shallow . However , the unrelenting self-loathing of the main character ( s ) in this book was almost intolerable . The two cultures at war are also quite repulsive . I wanted to admire the environmentally aware Specks more than the European-Imperialist Gernians , but I found both cultures reprehensible . Unfortunately , the nature-loving Specks also made me feel quite nauseous . The descriptions of their foods and their gluttonous , morbidly obese mages wore thin after just a few chapters . I may have lost a few pounds in the few days it took me to read this book . The lead character , who was a part of both cultures , was COMPLETELY LOATHSOME AND REPULSIVE in all of his forms . I don\'t think I\ 've ever felt such disgust for a villain in a fantasy novel , let alone the hero . At several points , the character wants to die , and I hoped that he would . SPOILER ALERTHe does die , thank goodness , but we are not spared . Even after he DIED , he was completely disgusting . Not only did both halves represent only NEGATIVE sides of his character , his physical aspects were as disgusting as anyone can imagine . Grossly , disgustingly , morbidly fat , and needing to eat constantly ? It is quite normal for humans to be repulsed by such a person . A culture which is based on greed and obesity and gluttony -- well , I can\'t imagine what Robin was thinking . Magic comes from FOOD ? Yeeeccccch ! ! ! ! Which brings me to the inherently repulsive Specks . A disgusting name for a vile and unappealing culture . Nature-lovers my foot , they are as greedy , materialistic and selfish as any Conquistador ! The source of their unique -- and hideously described -- dappled skin caused new depths of gut-churning disgust . They are grotesque looking , and their culture is not what it\ 's cracked up to be . They love material wealth , and will use items inimical to their own kind to achieve power . The Specks\ ' appearance , their magic , their culture -- all made me want to jump into the novel and wipe them out with smallpox . The Gernians weren\'t any better , but at least vaguely familiar . ( Conquistadors , Pioneers , Manifest Destiny , Genocide , etc . ) I was better prepared for how unsympathetic THEY were . Easy to despise , but I needed some good guys to route for ! Why , Robin ? WHY ? I have a high tolerance for the foibles of fantasy . I\ 'm giving the book two stars , because Ms .  Hobb DID create unusual situations , and she is quite a good writer . I hope to never read such morally and physically repugnant descriptions again ... I actually skipped the last chapters ( after a character is eaten by a tree , I was DONE ) . The ending was trite and predictable , shucks -- I wanted every character DEAD . Most of them were , thank goodness ! However , our disgusting hero wreaked out an improbable happy ending after all .

Every character has something about them that 's dislikeable and some parts that are great . In other words these characters even the minor ones are real . The story is about a War of Civilizations .

It 's only now that he 's come back to himself as a noble 's son at the last few paragraphs of the book that I 'd really like to find out what occurs . Does he save his family estate ? Does he make a name for himself and his family . What happens to his extended family and friends ? How is the east settled . What happens back in the capital ? I wish I had never read these three books , but I would n't mind reading what happens from this point forward . I doubt that will happen .

"Another reviewer suggested there was not a lot to enjoy in the Soldier 's Son trilogy . I have to agree , if we 're talking about the eating chocolates in the bubble bath kind of enjoyment . But there 's another kind of enjoyment I get from Hobb 's work . It 's the enjoyment of splitting wood in the rain . You feel virtuous for having done it ; you 've earned something by doing it ; you 're a little stronger and better now . My soul enjoyed it , even if my inner child wanted more laser beams , romance , and bad guy vanquishing . The first book was okay . The second just wore me down and depressed me . But I had faith in Hobb . She 's written some of the most psychologically interesting fantasy that anyone has *ever* written . It 's her and George R. R. Martin at the top , then Tolkien . Everyone else seems more than a peg lower on the deepness scale . If Robin Hobb makes me suffer , I trust that she 's preparing the way for a great finish . I believe she did that . As a man , I find her male characters often do n't quite think like men ( Witness the amazing hand-wringing over love issues that Fitz goes through in the Assassin 's series . He seemed incapable of thinking about sex as simple fun . Dude , come on . Note to Robin : study the male psyche a little more ... you almost have it ... ) However , her plots involve such self-psycho-torture that it works , anyway . Complexity is a tide that floats all boats . I 'm fascinated by the way she makes her characters walk a labyrinth before finding the payoff . Renegade 's Magic is a conclusion that redeems the prep work she 's done with the first two books . It never seems to drag . Yes the protagonist is kind of a spineless fool , but that 's because his spiny part was alienated from him by the Tree Woman . It 's like that episode of Star Trek where the nice Kirk gets split from nasty Kirk , and they are both impaired . I found this last book entertaining and satisfying . I recommend the series not because you will smile while reading it , but because -- if you are are a fan of human complexity -- reading it will annoy you like a deep muscle massage given by Angry Helga , and then leave you feeling kind of floaty and satisfied afterwards . At this point , I will read anything by Hobb , no matter what . I 'd like to see her write something with a decisive main character who does n't keep a million secrets and lie to everybody in a vain attempt to protect them ... but maybe that 's the only way she can make the plots complex enough for them to work their magic on us . I shall place myself in her capable hands .","'s work--Robin Hobb, series, 's work, second, last book, second--plots, 's work--Robin Hobb--Robin Hobb","Positive, Positive, Positive, Mixed, Positive, Positive, Positive",,

Unfortunately for Detective Sergeant Logan McRae , Knox\ 's new home is in Aberdeen , Scotland . Add Knox to a stew that contains gangsters from Edinburgh , a local crime lord , an inspector from Newcastle who wants to keep an eye on Knox , and folks from Newcastle looking for a missing mob accountant , and you can see that there\ 's more than enough to keep McRae busy for two or three lifetimes . His problem is that he\ 's still being jerked back and forth between two detective inspectors who can\'t seem to be able to live without McRae being at their beck and call every single hour of every single day . MacBride writes edgy , violent tales with such a finely-honed dark sense of humor that I\ 've often found myself laughing like a total nutter only a page or two after being left stunned and slightly sickened by something else . I know that makes me sound as if I\ 'm a bit schizophrenic , but perhaps being a bit unbalanced helps you to understand what\ 's going on once you\ 've immersed yourself in MacBride\ 's world . I find myself having very strong and very personal reactions to the books in this series now . Logan McRae has found himself caught between two superior officers for far too long .

Although I did my best to find the humor in what I went through , there wasn\'t much to be found , and as McRae\ 's woes keep going on a seemingly endless loop , almost every molecule of humor has been leached from the situation for me . I love the character of McRae too much to stop reading , so I\ 'm hoping that MacBride will be kinder to him in the next book ! Despite my negative reactions I found Dark Blood to be another excellent book in this series . All the plot lines seem hopelessly tangled , and it\ 's a miracle that McRae is able to sort out any of them at all . But MacBride reminds us that life isn\'t a fairy tale . Real life isn\'t neatly wrapped up and tied with a bow just as the last page is turned . The ending of Dark Blood may leave you as angry as it did me , but -- sadly -- what happens is far from being a new occurrence on planet Earth .

"*Review of unabridged audio version read by the author*This is Stuart MacBride 's sixth book in the Logan McRae series and they are not for the squeamish . To call them gruesome is to put it mildly . In fact I thought that in the fourth of the series , Flesh House , he overstepped the mark of what most would consider crime fiction and strayed into horror territory , and I was sorry I had read it . I had all but decided not to read any more , until the next in the series , Blind Eye , came out and was available in unabridged audio format read by the author himself . I was intrigued and bought it . Thankfully he , ( or maybe his publisher ? ) , seemed to have realised that he had gone too far in Flesh House , and the violence had been toned down . When you consider that , as the title hints , it involved people having their eyes gouged and burned out , you will get some idea of how hard edged the series can be . With Dark Blood the gruesome has been toned down another notch . However the author seems to take an almost schoolboy delight in throwing in as many bodily function references , with vomiting the current favourite , as he can , much to the detriment of some good plotting and great characters . MacBride does a very good job of most of the accents with which his characters speak , but I may be just a bit cynical in suspecting that he is giving characters accents which he can do . If so he might want to seek a second opinion on his 'Essex Girl' . Overall an enjoyable 'listen ' and good to see McRae at last winning one fight after so many second prizes , albeit injuring himself , AGAIN , in the process . If only someone in the editorial team could make the author excise the 'yeuch ' factor . The books may be reduced by 50 to 100 pages but would be much improved for it .","Flesh House, Logan McRae series, Blind Eye--job","Mixed, Negative, Positive",,
"Stuart MacBride has used a true crime story as the basis for this novel , the sixth in the Logan McRae series . It serves as the main case among the Detective Sergeant\ 's work overload , exacerbating his moodiness , drinking and smoking , all of which is heightened , of course , by his interaction with DI Steele , one of the more interesting characters in the genre . On top of her continually riding Logan , he has to cope with another superior , incompetent DI Beattie . The main plot involves Richard Knox , a man convicted of raping an elderly grandfather . After serving his time , Knox decides to come to Aberdeen and occupy his late grandmother\ 's home . He is brought to the Scottish city by DI Danby , who originally arrested him . The arrival of Knox sets off waves of protest and his house is burned down . He is whisked off to a safe house , from which he is sooon kidnapped . Logan , among others , has the task of protecting Knox , so it falls to him to find him and the reason for his abduction . At the same time , DI Danby disappears , doubling Logan\ 's task . The lengthy novel is awash in various subplots , keeping Logan busy virtually 24/7 . It seems he has to stop a flood of counterfeit currency in Aberdeen , the murder of a confidential informant , and a couple of jewelry store robberies , among other side issues . All in a day\ 's ( or week\ 's ) work . Despite the book\ 's length , it is fast reading , tautly plotted and engrossing . Logan , Steele and the other characters are all interesting , and the dialogue , as usual , sparkling .

"After reading six books in the series I have become a reluctant fan of author Stuart MacBride . His books just gallop along from one violent activity to another . The characters are so complex as to be almost unbelievable . DI Steele is a case in point - she is so 'way out ' there , so vulgar , so rough , but in a funny way she becomes almost 'cute ' and likeable ...  . but it does take six books to get to this point . There are plots within plots within plots ...  . puts the book into the 'almost can not put down ' category . However if left for 24 hours it can be difficult to pick up where it left off . Nevertheless ( and in small doses ) Mr MacBride 's books are thoroughly enjoyable ... .I am looking forward to reading book 7 after a short period of recovery reading one of James Oswald 's crime mysteries ( a colleague and apparently good friend of Mr MacBride ) .","book--DI Steele, book 7, book--Mr MacBride, book, book--way, Mr MacBride 's books","Mixed, Positive, Positive, Mixed, Positive, Positive",,

"Paroled rapist Richard Knox decides he wants to make a new life in the Aberdeen , forcing Granite Citys finest to protect him from an outraged populace . Meanwhile MacBride 's recurring hero DS Logan McRae is under the cosh from all directions : his superiors are overloading him and questioning his attitude ; hes hitting the drink increasingly hard ; hes spending more time before Professional Standards than dealing with his massive caseload packed with counterfeit money and goods , murder , flashers , and robbery ; and the local crime lord is leaving him envelopes of cash ... MacBrides touch for character interaction and team dynamics ( complete with realistic if coarse language and off-colour humour ) is once again to the fore , as he delivers another solid instalment in an excellent series . Readers cant help but feel for ( and follow ) beleaguered McRae , as he tries to weather the storms both natural and political , solve several cases , pull himself from his malaise , and decide if he even wants to remain a cop . Not the best in the series , but a good read nonetheless - with several ongoing issues between recurring characters moved forward ( or moved , anyway ) . I still miss DI Insch , but DI Steel is once again at her entertaining foul-mouthed best , McRae also has more to cope with in terms of his barely-competent colleague 'Beardy ' Beattie being promoted to DI ahead of him , and several other colourful characters are also introduced . An entertaining and enjoyable read that is n't quite as brutal as the recent Blind Eye and Flesh House , but still has plenty of MacBride 's usual mix of grimness , gore , and guffaws .","read--DI Steel, read","Positive, Positive",,

"I started with the first Logan McRae book and am working my way through the series . This is definitely the best so far . Most of the familiar characters are back , but there\ 's a new depth to their relationships that at times is surprisingly moving . As always , there are a lot of inter-woven plot lines . Judging from the reviews , some people find this confusing , but I found it a realistic representation of a copper\ 's workload and admired the way MacBride brought most of them together at the end without it feeling forced . Edinburgh is as bleak as always , and so is the overall mood . But unlike some of the earlier novels , this one is relatively free from stomach-turning torture and other horrors ( though don\'t get me wrong : this ain\'t Young Adult fiction )  . The writing is crisp , with nary a missed beat . The language feels real and believable . Characters have distinctive voices without sounding like caricatures . And it\ 's a very hard book to put down . As other reviewers have said , this is probably not the best place to start the series , as a fair amount of background knowledge is assumed . So stop reading me , and start reading the other five so you won\'t have to wait long to read Dark Blood .","book--language, one, book--writing, book","Positive, Negative, Positive, Positive",,

"If you are a fan of Stuart MacBride , and the characters he chronicles in his ongoing series about the Aberdeen police , this book will most likely appeal to you , as well . Most of your favorites are back , although some take a distinct step into the background in this one . If you are not yet a fan , or are relatively new to the series DO NOT start out with this one . MacBride makes no attempt to introduce his characters ; he apparently figures that the reader already knows who these people are and what makes them tick from his prior novels . Unfortunately , he therefore gives little weight to those who are NOT familiar with them , or who need a little ( or a lot of ) reminder as to who they are . Even without that background , this book comes in around 500 pages . In my opinion ( admittedly a big fan of the authors ) , it is a good investment of time for those who have a solid background in the Aberdeen Police Department as MacBride has painted them in the past . As usual , MacBride has several plot threads going on at once , just as an actual police department would have multiple cases running coincidentally . However , also as usual , MacBride finds ways to show a connection sometimes tight , sometimes tangentially between these cases . Go ahead and buy this book , BUT put it aside if you have not yet read Cold Granite , or Flesh House , or ( especially ) the prior book , Blind Eye come back to this one after youve completed his earlier 5 books .

"This is the second Logan McRae novel , following on from Cold Granite . Aberdeen is slightly warmer in this book , but that is more of less the only concession to being light hearted in a gritty and compelling thriller . Not that there is no humour the author has the ability to bring an ironic touch to the darkest scenes but this is not a crime novel for the faint hearted . However , sometimes you want a crime novel which is realistic and violent , and this ticks every box ; brilliantly plotted and fantastically written . When we meet up with McRae again , he is in disgrace after being in charge of a raid which ended with a police constable being shot . Now he is under investigation and working with D . I .

There is certainly no lack of crimes to choose from ? Firstly , someone is stalking and killing prostitutes , secondly , an arsonist is locking buildings securely before torching those inside and , thirdly , bizarrely , a dogs torso is found in a suitcase ...

Many recurring characters appear here - even Colin Miller makes a cameo ! And there are several laugh-out-loud hilarious scenes of dialogue and banter ( many surrounding a new addition to the DS pool - Biohazard Bob ) . Logan himself continues to fall far from his once hero/goldenboy status . But even through his struggles and missteps , he remains a likable and sympathetic hero .

"Mr .  Burrell has nothing much to say here . It has all been said before . I enjoyed the rare pictures inside Diana 's home at Kensington Palace . The rooms did indeed look cozy and inviting , although her dining room looked rather sparse and unfinished , with cheap-looking bamboo chairs , which was quite surprising to me . Ditto her famous dressing room . I also enjoyed the paragraphs his sons wrote - hence the two stars . But while reading this book , I experienced an annoying sense of dj vu ! One can extract , word for word , paragraphs repeated directly from ` A Royal Duty ' . This is such old , tired news I almost skipped pages . Although I did enjoy ` A Royal Duty ' , I was shocked at Mr .  Burrell 's admission that he had lied in that book - but thankfully , he informs us , it was only a ` white lie ' to ` protect ' the Princess . Here he does a great disservice to her and completely ruins his credibility . One ca n't help wondering what other ` white lies ' he has told . Why lie at all , only to expose yourself in your latest book ? He also devotes paragraphs on how he needs to set the record straight , and how it has tortured him to even think of revealing the next ` secret ' , then , in the very next line - guess what ? - he ` reveals ' ( or rather , repeats ) it ! It is disturbing and very evident that Diana had a kind of Svengali-like hold over him . And he was willing , spellbound , and impossibly obsessed with this woman . It is never more obvious than in this book . My recommendation is that he should release a book of photographs of Diana 's home and some other private photos as a pretty coffee table picture-book ! That would be far more interesting , and he wo n't be torturing himself while revealing yet another ` secret ' .","book, A Royal Duty, book--paragraphs","Mixed, Positive, Positive",,

"I was hoping for a book that would provide a more insightful book about the late princess . The relationship between Mr .  Burrell and Diana was portrayed as being very chummy . It was not at all as I would have imagined a professional relationship between a princess and a butler to actually be . I would have imagined such a job to be more about professional obligations and work and less about discussing which dress to wear and dishing about dates . I couldn\'t quite put my finger on it , but at the end of the book , I ended up feeling ( as the reader ) that the book was just not as accurate . Or if it was , it was a bit disheartening to learn that Diana was a KFC fan and enjoyed listening to Disney movie soundtracks and reading self-help books . Not exactly the high-brow life one envisions for royalty . Or that Diana was not a great friend to have and was off and on with her few friends . Some of her interactions with Sarah Ferguson and a few others left me with the feeling that I was reading about a circle of girls in Junior High and not about sophisticated grown women who moved in circles of power and wealth . If my friend made me feel that way about running late to get to an airport ( after failing to give me the right time and information ) , I don\'t think I would consider them much of a friend . Not to knock someone who isn\'t around to speak for themselves , but this book didn\'t seem to elevate Diana\ 's memory as much as I had hoped it would .

"While I preferred A Royal Duty more than The Way We Were : Remembering Diana , I still found this book entertaining . This book basically adds more of a dimension of Diana than A Royal Duty where Burrell spent much of the text on himself from childhood on , his work with the Queen , and how he handled Diana 's sudden death . The Way We Were focuses more on Diana 's relationships with friends and her interest in Dr .  Hasnat Khan . Burrell remained friendly with Khan , even giving him one of Diana 's perfume-scented headbands . This is Burrell 's second book on Diana . From my perspective , I find the ongoing criticism against Burrell unnecessary and ridiculous . He is frequently accused of betraying her trust but I believe none of the critics give a nickel about Diana 's trust being betrayed . The most criticism is made by other authors who are also writing about the princess . Probably the attacks are made because Burrell actually worked for Diana and knew her better than outsiders like Andrew Morton , Tina Brown , Penny Junor , Ingrid Seward , and others . Whenever I read another book on Diana , I always find a snipe or two about Paul Burrell in the text . These attacks are becoming tiresome and makes the author look petty and cheap . The bottom line for the criticism seems others want to make money off the continuing popularity of Princess Diana . Why should anyone buy the other author 's books when the reader can find out more details and more truths about Diana 's lifestyle and mindset from Burrell ? Books written by these other writers obviously have the slanted best interest of the royal family in mind as they compose every page .","A Royal Duty, Burrell, book","Positive, Positive, Positive",,

"Where his first book A Royal Duty told the story of his life in royal service including Diana , this book deals with his service to Diana only . It is very easy to read , as he takes us step by step through apartments 8 and 9 at Kensington Palace , and includes photos of the rooms where Diana spent most of her time . This book covers her life after the separation from Charles until her death , and reveals the good and bad about her . Some of the bad was the way she would drop friends like a stone if they upset her , and the good was if they were in her favor she would do anything for them . One example was of her letting a friend bury her baby in secret at Kensington Palace . Some other revelations are the details of her relationship with Hasnat Khan who her friends believed was The One , and was just using Dodi to make him jealous . Also her relationships with celebrities , her boys , Sarah Duchess of York , and her strained relationship with her mother and brother . Mr .  Burrell covers her death and funeral , and tells us what it was like to see her body in Paris before bringing her home . There has been a lot of controversy about Paul Burrell , but I think it is obvious by this book that he loved and respected Diana , and was devastated by her death .

"No one knew the multi-faceted Diana , Princess of Wales like Paul Burrell did . Once again he evokes her memory and captures the majesty of the delicate chameleon we knew , simply and lovingly , as Diana . In a lifetime that was all too brief she accomplished what no other Royal has . Until the reign of Elizabeth II , no one really bothered about the monarchy . We came into the age of television and reached toward the age of technology as Elizabeth II was crowned and reached toward her reign as Queen in an age of enlightenment . I am quite certain she could never foresee the likelihood of a modern day Princess reaching out to the people in the way H.R.H . Diana extended herself and touched those she would never know or may never see again . The Monarchy seemed to be hidden behind palace doors , but not Diana ... never Diana . The Queen has possession and guardianship of the crown jewels during her reign . The brightest of those was one she could never possess or pass on . The most brilliant and brightest star was Diana , the Queen of Hearts and the People\ 's Princess who served her people by being out among them and giving of herself to them whenever and wherever she could . The charity in her heart was endless as she was tireless in her contribution to those who suffered . The Queen always thought she knew her people well . The death of Diana proved that to be a total misconception . It is my belief that since the British people had been exposed to another way of being and another way of doing things , they weren\'t going back to a time when things happened around them . It is also my belief that the next reign will take a lesson from Diana\ 's ways and rule with true spirit , openess and generosity of heart .

"I came to this book with an open mind as i was in the States or abroad while all the Diana intrigue was going on and i do n't read magazines . I 'm from London . Facinating-so it says the Queen had a nanny who later behaved like an imperious queen because she had so many confidences from thee Queen and the royal house-hold tip-toed around her or it was 'off with their heads'and she drank champagne ONLY of it was served on a platter . Then , in another book on Diana , it says Charles 's butler used to have his music blaring from the floor below the Queen mother 's at Balmoral . My point is when servants get all the close confidences of their royal masters/mistresses it makes them feel personally royal too . A huge promotion considering they started off their careers as brown-nosers . So reading this book i could n't help feeling the same thing had happened to Mr Burrell and it would count as a drop in prestige to mention anything untoward about Diana . The ego shining through this book was my constant companion so i read it like an article in a woman 's magazine ...",book,Positive,,
"I have read everything Diana for years and find Paul 's books to likely be closest to the truth . If you look at them objectively , they really are n't very flattering . I sometimes wonder if he realizes how intensely painful it is to read of his service to someone who was obviously cracked in the head . Not just a little , either . I am solidly convinced Diana was a well-intentioned , howling loon , which is very obviously what Paul does n't want anyone to think . The trouble is that he is distressingly honest about his impressions , so much so , that you can feel him fight with his own conscience about what and what not to share . He strikes me as an empathetic person who truly helping her hold it together on pain of his employment . I understood Diana to have issues with some of her staff , and yes , Paul does go into a bit of that with the same truthful tone that dominates all his writings . It really does nothing to evoke sympathy for her character , although Paul 's innate empathy - a talent that must have been particularly attractive to the Windsors - strives to do so . He really did feel a specific devotion towards Diana , and after reading his books , I think it may have to do with his believing he made a genuine difference in her life . Perhaps he did ? It 's difficult to tell from Paul 's perspective , as he does attempt in places to adhere to an impartiality that lends credibility to his story . It all just seems so terrifically sad . From her relationship with the heart surgeon , Dr .  Hasnat , to the way she confided things to Paul that he had no business being burdened with , you get the idea that this charming , sophisticated Princess was daft as a box of frogs and boiling not to show it . You also achieve about half way through the book that Paul , despite his candor , is concealing that much more which would obviously cement a brutal impression of someone who was struggling with any number of bewildering issues . It 's not just Diana , though . The system that she lived in was daft from end to end , and Paul was part and parcel of it . She 's dead , and he 's gone away from the royal family now , which is likely to improve Paul 's own family 's situation . He 's selling wine and things , and has branded his name , which in my opinion , should have happened long ago , as he solidly deserves notoriety for pleasing a group of tragically difficult people stuck in an Edwardian reality .","book--Paul--service, book, book--service, Paul","Negative, Negative, Negative, Mixed",,

"Kind of a combination Diana/Paul Burrell biography The way We were tells about various aspects of Diana\ 's life , mostly in the final years . You will find some material familiar , some of it told from a different viewpoint to what we\ 're used to . I take it as a sort of butler\ 's eye view of the Princess\ 's life/ death with inside details and opinions on her love life ( he says the Dodi thing wasn\'t real , just a fling ) , the dress sale and Diana\ 's friendships among other subjects . Mr .  Burrell doesn\'t do much Royal bashing , doesn\'t attack the Spencer family , mentions other books but doesn\'t deride them . It was a nice touch having his sons each write a page or two about their memories of the Princess . There is some I and We stuff but mostly the book rings true to me . I have a feeling that very little material here can be dismissed as unreliable , a little too self promoting maybe but still reliable . Burrell does have several pictures of Kensington Palace that he took himself and may very well have been busy taking notes as some enemies charge but over all the book is a memorial to/ defense of Princess Diana as he says it is . The book is definitely worth owning , much better that Burrell\ 's obviously envious critics ( Ingrid Seward in this month\ 's Majesty Magazine is one of the worst ) are willing to give him credit for . It is an inside source , maybe the only one we\ 're going to ever get , and worth reading . If you have an interest in Diana you won\'t regret getting the book .",book,Positive,,
"Yes , clearly this man was devoted to and even worshipped his employer and , overall , the book was written from a respectful point of view . For an avid Diana fan , the innocent day-to-day insight is appreciated , however , certain facts should not have been revealed . For example , revealing that the Princess gave her close friend permission to bury a stillborn baby in her private garden . How must the parents feel about this information being published ? What a nightmare for them . How would the Princess feel ? This was so over the top it blatantly betrays the trust Diana placed in him . As for the interior photos of Kensington Palace , in my opinion , I believe Mr Burrell has played into the hands of his critics . Taking these photos after her death reveals a certain agenda . Was it his place to take these photos and reveal them to the world ? Kensington Palace was Diana 's sanctuary and I doubt the Princess would be pleased with this intrusion .","book--Diana, book--innocent day-to-day insight, This","Positive, Positive, Negative",,
"I read Burrell\ 's other book , A Royal Duty and came away feeling that the author was obsessed with his employer and that he was a neurotic . Addtionally , I was inclined to think his character was somewhat questionable due to the surrounding Scotland Yard case against him ( although he was acquitted ) as well comments made by others during interviews I\ 've seen and other things I\ 've read . However , I really thought this book , The Way We Were was a nice tribute to Diana , Princes of Wales , and I think Burrell did a nice job in tyring to dispel the myths , gossip , and rumors that have surrounded this much written about subject . I particulary enjoyed reading his recollections about Diana\ 's relationship with Hasnat Khan and his two sons\ ' recollections of their childhood friendship with Princes William and Harry . These new bits of information were delivered in a heart-felt manner , and most importantly , I believe the contents of the book to be absolutely true .

I highly recommend this book to anyone who is interested in British royalty and Diana , Princess of Wales .","book--job, book","Positive, Positive",,

"Three sisters of the same father , Kristina , Celeste , and Juliana , describe their harrowing accounts of childhoods . Instead of being children , they were sexual slaves and slaves to the cause for the Children of God cult . This book is quite a read but it 's important to realize how the Children of God or the Family International operate in order to destroy them . The Children of God and the Family International is nothing more than a cult focused on sexual orgies with minor children involved such as the young girls on the cover . Their father , Christopher Jones , should have protected them all along . But part of cult culture is the separation of children from their biological parents or those who will protect them from the abuse . Cult culture is bent on secrecy , lies , deception , and illusions . Their late leader , David Berg , was seen as the supreme being rather than a human being . His death did not help in it 's organization 's deconstruction . Like other cults , the Children of God changed their name to the Family Internationl . The sisters here provide an insider 's look into this twisted world where children are routinely abused in various ways particularly sexually . Another issue with this cult is that they move around frequently rather than stay in one place . They keep a low profile and try to maintain a sense of normalcy to outsiders . The insiders like the sisters here write about the illusions to the public and to outsiders such as relatives who visit their loved ones . This book is a triumph against the Children of God for revealing shocking accounts of blatant abuse of children and even it 's adult members . The Children of God leaders make decisions for the children and the adults . Their mysterious founder David Berg lived on the run and in hiding much like Bin-Laden . He sent messages through his trusted advisors to his members about the end of the world and how to train soldiers for the end-times . The girls ' father Christopher Jones blindly accepted David Berg 's leadership and his word as the holy gospel . He believed Berg was a prophet and not a pedophile . Even in the end , I do n't think their father realized the overwelming damage that the Children of God inflicted upon his own offspring . Often , he was out of their lives and on missions for the organization . He was a true believer who never doubted his prophet unfortunately . For three sisters , they had to learn to escape the Children of God cult not just physically but emotionally , psychologically , and sexually as well . When you join a cult or are born into one such as the Children of God , your mind is not yours to begin with and neither were their souls and bodies . This book will help in stopping Family International and exposing their practices . The sisters have done a brave job in detailing painful memories and experiences of their lives . My heart goes out to them and all the other survivors . My only complaint about the book is the lack of photographs except for the cover and back . Another complaint is the writing is a bit off . But other than that , their experiences are invaluable for those survivors out there .","world, book--accounts of childhoods, book, book--experiences, book--Christopher Jones, accounts of blatant abuse of children","Negative, Negative, Mixed, Positive, Negative, Negative",,
"I WANTED to like this book . I really did . I have been in a phase of reading books about kids and/or adults caught in the clutches of cult like religions , such as the offshoots of the LDS and those like it . This seemed to fit into that category , so I went ahead and bought it . I wish I hadn\'t spent the money . Truthfully , this book is first off , fairly poorly written . It comes across as one of the types of books one can buy for 99 cents for the Kindle . Also , it seems to be written in such a way as to appeal to those who are looking for titillating scenarios of older men forcing young girls ( think ten years old and younger ) into extremely sexual situations . I\ 'm not into soft porn ( or any porn ) nor do I want to hear graphic details of a beyond middle aged man forcing a child to perform oral sex on him . Granted , I assumed that when the synopsis mentioned the girls being forced to get married at young ages and being violated , it was obvious that one aspect of that would be sexually . But the premise of the book SEEMED to be the aspects involving the mistreatment of the women/girls in the faith more than anything . That wasn\'t the case however . This book was simply a showcase written to draw in those who want lurid pedophilia type details . So if that is what you are looking for , you\ 'll like this book . If however , your interest lies in reading about religions that are actually cults in disguise or the mistreatment and subjugation of women in certain religions , this isn\'t the book for you . While that is mentioned of course , it is pretty much mentioned only to relate how the girls were sexually abused ... in detail .","book--premise, book, book--way","Negative, Mixed, Negative",,
"From the time they were toddlers , sisters Celeste and Kristina Jones , and Juliana Buhring , were forced to endure an array of daily horrors no child should ever have to experience . Their parents allowed the other members of Children of God , the cult of which they were part , to rape the girls , to force them into performing sexual acts on adult men and baby boys alike , to perform stripteases on video for Grandpa , their leader . The smallest question or resistance resulted in brutal beatings , isolation , starvation for days on end , or even disappearing . It was clear that no one ever left Children of God . Yet none of the three sisters ever believed this way of life was correct . Deeply unhappy from their earliest days , all Celeste , Kristina and Juliana longed for was a normal life on the outside , with their parents and other siblings . Most of the time , however , it seemed impossible . Despite the odds , however , all three girls eventually escaped . Bearing their own emotional scars , they now devote their lives to sharing their story with others , and helping all the child victims of cults around the world . The story told by the three sisters in this book is eye-opening and brutally honest , yet at no point overly sentimental or self-pitying . Rather , they simply tell things as they were , and readers will root for the three to find their freedom .","story, story--horrors, story--beatings","Mixed, Negative, Negative",,

"I was a first generation COG member and met my wife in the organization in 1973 . Mo came out with a letter called Declaration of Independence , so we declared our independence in the fall of 1973 . I had sensed that the organization would take its toll on marriage and family life . In July of this year I had a nephew who grew up in the COG committ suicide . Another nephew who grew up in the organization had the phrase Never Ending Struggle on a tee shirt for his band after leaving The Family . Google Mick Bysshe Strange Fire to read one chapter of my account of living in The Family , as they often called themselves . This book is a painful telling . I would suggest that you write down notes and keep track of the authors as you do so so that the thread of the tale remains coherent . Many of those who have been first generation life long converts are pretty naive hippies from the 1970s and 1960s with not a clue as to what is right and wrong . The father of these three girls comes across as a total jerk , typical of lifelong first generation members I would imagine . It is also important to note that David Berg was not the first nor will he be the last to engage in physical , emotional , and sexual abuse of minors . Those responsible must be brought to justice in a court of law , or failing that in the court of public opinion .

"The sisters were second-generation members of the Children of God -- the same cult as the books Jesus Freaks and Heaven\ 's Harlots told about . In fact , they knew Davidito , the subject of Jesus Freaks and several of the people mentioned in Heaven\ 's Harlots . But these stories are not duplicative ; each has her own angle on the subject . Their stories of abuse are all the more chilling because they are told so matter-of-factly . Example : Everything was rigidly scheduled -- from school hours to one hour of exercise time in the garden . We even had scheduled \'date\ ' times , where we each picked the partner we were to have sex with , held out our hands for a glob of pink baby lotion and proceeded to our various beds . The adults used KY jelly , but for some reason baby lotion was the lubricant of choice for us little ones . [ She was five years old at the time . ] We knew what to do , as we had seen our teachers at it often enough , though we were a little lacking in the actual mechanics . Generally , the boy got on top of the girl , and a lot of sounds followed in the general rhythm of \'Ooh -- Aah , Ooh -- Aah , Ooh -- Aah\' . Or this , when one of the sisters was about ten : Often , the shepherds would take me into a private room for correction -- for the usual sins : rebellion , worldliness and lack of hunger for the Word of God . It seemed to me that they just had it in for me . The Home shepherd , an Indian man named Matthew , scared me . He would shout at me until he got me to cry , and the he would smile . \'Now tell me you love me . Do you love me ? \'\'No . \ ' I looked at him hatefully . His eyes grew fiery and he grabbed my head with his two hands and held my face an inch from his own . \'Tell me you love me , or you can\'t leave this room .  \'He played this little power struggle game until he had wrested the words out of me . Then he would kiss me all over my face and hug me for what seemed like hours before finally allowing me to leave . And that\ 's one of the milder incidents . The most sickening part is at the end , when Juliana confronts her father with his abuse and neglect , and tolerance for the abuse she suffered at the hands of others . He will not accept that anything happened , even though he knows that it did . He falls back on cliches and slogans from the now-dead Moses David , and reiterates that the end times are going to be soon , and then she and her sisters will come crawling back to the Family .  < a data-hook=product-link-linked class=a-link-normal href=/Jesus-Freaks-A-True-Story-of-Murder-and-Madness-on-the-Evangelical-Edge/dp/0061118060/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt ? ie=UTF8 > Jesus Freaks : A True Story of Murder and Madness on the Evangelical Edge < /a > < a data-hook=product-link-linked class=a-link-normal href=/Heaven-s-Harlots-My-Fifteen-Years-in-a-Sex-Cult/dp/0688170129/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt ? ie=UTF8 > Heaven\ 's Harlots : My Fifteen Years in a Sex Cult < /a >",stories of abuse,Negative,,
"While not a perfect literary book , it is an excellent account of three girls growing up in a truly sick environment . It is interesting to note however that while the cult was successful in brainwashing its adult ( 1st generation ) followers , they were not very successful in brainwashing the children ( 2nd generation ) born into the cult . I think this was the fatal flaw that David Burg never imagined . He assumed the children would follow without question and accept any violations enacted upon them . He did not realize that children can develop egos and an innate understanding of right and wrong at very young ages . So his experiment in brainwashing children was a failure . However , there are still many 1st generation adults who are still brainwashed to this day and are following Burg\ 's writings as if they are the word of God . It is these sad adults who deny that any children were abused because the way they see it if an adult rapes and beats a child in the name of love it is not abuse . As a follow up to this book , I would recommend reading The Children of God , the Inside Story by Deborah Davis ( Linda Burg ) , David Burg\ 's oldest daughter . While not as dramatic it provides great insight into the COG and cults in general .","book--flaw, book--account of three girls, book, book--adults, book--environment","Negative, Positive, Mixed, Negative, Negative",,

"Ill start this review out by saying that I am an amateur author . I know my writing is n't New York Times Best Selling material , I can be honest with myself . I edit my own work , as editing services can be pricey . BUTRaymond E. Feist IS an award winning , New York Times Best Selling Author . He has a writing contract and has professional editors working with him . And my books are still better edited than this book . Period . Hands down , my favorite author in the genre , possibly favorite in all genres , Feist let me down with this book . There were gaping holes in the plot , multiple ( I mean lots ) incomplete sentences and a truly lackluster approach that left me feeling cheated . There is a part of the story early on where Pug ( THE main character , in my opinion ) and two others are investigating an island and stumble onto something amazing . The chapter ends . About 100 pages later , the storyline switches to Pugs son , Magnus , talking with the two companions of Pug from the earlier chapter and he says , You need to tell my father what weve found on this island . Really ? Magnus did n't find it , Pug did . That is a major error . You cant fix that . And he didnt . It just went from there , and got worse . I dare say I found an error of some sort on every other page . The storyline was n't anything I hadnt read from Feist before , either . A princess needs to escape before she is forced into a marriage she doesnt want , blah , blah , blah . Its almost the same exact storyline as the original four books of this lengthy series . Granted , I still read it , as I love the world he has created . But really ? Come up with something different . And the title , A Crown Imperiledwhich crown ? I can make an assumption , but it really was n't as main a part of the storyline as I would have expected . Okay , enough complaining . The book is critical to the series , but it felt like it was written by someone else other that the named author . I still enjoy the world developed , and I still love the characters Feist has created . I have already forgiven him and have moved on to the last book in the series . I just hope it doesnt leave me the way this one left me.2.5 of 5 Stars ( rounds to 3 , just because its Feist )","book--characters, book--approach, book--gaping holes in the plot, book, book--world, book--Feist, book--storyline, book--sentences, A Crown Imperiledwhich, It","Positive, Negative, Negative, Mixed, Positive, Positive, Negative, Negative, Negative, Negative",,

"Feist is one of my favorite authors . I have followed Pug 's adventures and trials through most of the different min-series . The Chaos War set continues to be well written , but in A Crown Imperiled I think the author is trying flip from one sub plot to the next too quickly . Yes , the reader is aware of what the main characters are doing almost simultaneously , but it jumps around too much for my taste , particularly toward the end of the book . I would prefer longer segments for the exploits of the different character groupings .

"Feist continues the not inconsiderable feat of balancing the mundane action of characters with swords and action on a cosmic scale with magic to shake planets . There is so much history in all of the Riftwar Cycle as it is now being called that the storyline tends to jump back and forth and is slightly hard to follow . This could partly be to rather stealthy formatting page breaks in the Kindle version -- I would sometimes read a whole paragraph before realizing that venues had shifted . I did not notice glaring editorial problems as some have reported -- just a few typos . The transitions , however , do make me wonder what might be Feist and what might be the translation process from book to ebook . Not enough to detract from the story significantly , IMO . Still , not quite the effortless , simple prose we know Feist is capable of . Sometimes it seemed that Feist was laboring to convey his story -- not sure if this is simply the complexity of a world grown over nearly 30 books , or Feist powering through and not taking time in his rewrites , but parts were uncharacteristically clunky . Still , Feist always has a way of keeping things interesting , his characters are simple but lovable , and there is enough that is fresh despite the fact that there have been so many books that the story moves on at a satisfactory pace .","story, transitions, story--storyline, parts, way, formatting page breaks, characters","Mixed, Negative, Negative, Negative, Positive, Negative, Positive",,

This is the first time a book was ever ruined for me because of horrible editing and proof reading . Then there was the whole chapter with the wrong character involved . And you simply can not correct it by substituting the other character because much in that chapter was intended to reference the character who was written in and not the one intended . I am so glad this was not the last book of the series because it surely would have left me extremely disappointed . The mistakes are so glaring that it actually soured my read of the entire book . I bought the Kindle Version and bought it over a year after the book 's release . Yet in spite of promises to correct the original errors , the publisher is either too lazy or just does n't care enough to do so . Shame on Mr .  Feist for not calling the Publisher to task on this . Shame on the Editor for letting these errors through . I hope you were demoted . Shame on the Proofreader who probably did not do their job in the first place .

"For those who have followed Pug of Midkemia over his many adventures and challenges since his youth , this book is a twist . Not to ruin anything , buty the Pantathians , as described in the first in this series , are back ... with a twist . If you are a riftwar fan , this is a must read",book,Positive,,

"The Kingdom of the Isles is under siege , invaded by the Keshians as they try to re-take the Western Realm . A moredhel seems fated to protect Pug . Demons walk in human guise , adopting the personalities of those long thought dead . Mutiny seems to be hatching in 3 nations . The Star Elves seem to have their own agenda . While Pug and his allies ponder a magical mystery which may somehow be linked to all of this madness . There is much to like in this book . I\ 'll admit , Feist does particularly well when he\ 's tearing Midkemia asunder ( think Rage of a Demon Queen ) . Here he ties together magic , spies , political intrigue and military action into a fine web , reeling the reader in . Personally , I couldn\'t stop reading as I got into the final 100 or so pages ( and went in to work rather bleary eyed a few hours later ) . Honestly , though , I was blown away by the ending , and made me eager for the final installment . I\ 've been with Feist throughout the whole journey , starting with Magician as a kid ( and back then , in England , it was released as one HUGE book ) . I already have the next book purchased - I downloaded it onto my Kindle over the weekend . Part of me is excited to know what happens next , and another part of me is dreading the final chapter in the entire saga . I\ 'm also curious if they\ 'll ever release all the books as a box set , or maybe as a digital set on the Kindle ... ? The only part which didn\'t make much sense to me ( and seemed like a huge waste of time , or perhaps a page filler ) was the journey of Hal , Ty , Stephane and Gabriella . Anyway , if you\ 're a fan of Feist , get this book as I doubt you\ 'll be disappointed - the paperback version that I got seems to be free of the errors that plagued the hardcover . If you are new to Feist , I\ 'd recommend at least going back to the start of the Chaoswar trilogy ...  . preferably back to the first in the series , Magician . I highly recommend this book .","book--final 100 or so pages, book--ending, book, book--final chapter in the entire saga","Positive, Positive, Mixed, Negative",,

"I\ 've been with Raymond Feist and the world of Midkemia almost the whole ride since 1982 , and with the publication of A Crown Imperiled ( Harper Voyager , $ 27 . 99 , 469 pages ) , he is one book removed from wrapping up the saga of Pug the magician and the battle against the undefined evil known as the Dread . A Crown Imperiled , which is book two of the Chaoswar Saga , is book 28 of the Riftwar Cycle , which actually began in the mid-1970s as a role-playing game at the University of California at San Diego . And even though one might expect Feist to be going through the motions at this point , the world has become so richly imagined that he is able to keep both his own and his readers\ ' enthusiasm going after 30 years . So if you have liked any of Feist\ 's previous books , you\ 'll enjoy A Crown Imperiled - and if you\ 're a fan of high fantasy ( that is , a pre-industrial world with magic and other races aside from human ) , then go back and start with Magician , as Feist has carefully crafted a long-running series that has evolved into one of the best of its kind . Of course , some books are better than others , and in this one , Feist can\'t resist bringing back some characters he already killed off -- but at least he doesn\'t go the lengths Brian Herbert and Kevin Anderson did in their sorry finish to the Dune series . Feist has never been great on the romance aspect of such novels , and A Crown Imperiled is no exception , but there are some surprises that keep the pages turning , and have me looking forward to the next , and supposedly final , volume .","series, A Crown Imperiled, A Crown Imperiled--surprises, Feist, A Crown Imperiled--world","Positive, Mixed, Mixed, Positive, Positive",,

"I have been reading Feist since he began writing ; I even got the chance to meet him in a small book store when he would make small appearances ( back before he became popular ) . He was an impressive man to meet . But with every new Feist book , the font size gets bigger and the margins wider . Compare a Feist book to a Martin or Erikson book there are 10 times the amount of words per page . I avoid buying Feist in hardcover because I feel as though I am already buying half a book , why spend the extra for half anyway . He seems to just be pushing the books out for the money and nothing else , shame . But that being said , I still like the characters , the story and his style . I am always entertained .","style, Feist, story, characters","Positive, Mixed, Positive, Positive",,
"With this , the second volume of The Chaoswar Saga and the second-to-last volume of the entire Riftwar Cycle , Raymond E. Feist does n't necessarily advance the story , but instead elaborates on the significance of the events in A Kingdom Besieged , and builds some necessary ( and much-appreciated ) depth on the part of the characters . While it left me impatient to move on with the story , to advance things towards the ominously titled Magician 's End , it was largely satisfying in terms of securing the overall story arc . A Crown Imperiled does three things exceptionally well . Number one , it reestablishes the Conclave of Shadows as a force to be reckoned with , giving them not only power , but a purpose . The period of mourning their losses is over , Pug is invested in the fate of Midkemia once again , and Magnus seems finally positioned to fulfill the critical role his family legacy has so long demanded . More than that , the psudeo-resurrections of Miranda and Nakor that had me groaning at the end of the first book are not only explained , but handled exceptionally well . The scene in which Pug is confronted with a demon who carries all of his dead wife 's feeling and memories is one of the strongest emotional moments Feist has ever written . Number two , the book sheds some light on those subtle political coups taking place across the land . I felt they were really underplayed in the first book - introduced and hinted at , but left very vague in terms of exactly what was happening any why . Here , we see that aspect of the tale really expanded upon , elevating a lackluster minor plot thread to a level of significance worthy of Midkemia 's final chapter . Hal , Martin , and Brendan are drawn back into the heart of the conflict , elevating their tangential adventures into something as relevant as they are exciting . The entire flight sequence with Princess Stephan & eacute ; is probably the most exciting , swashbuckling event the series has seen in quite some time . Number three , the book has some big . . . and I do mean BIG . . . moments . I wo n't spoil them here , other than to say there is a scene with dragons taking flight that has me grinning with excitement , and a world-ending cliffhanger that had my jaw dropping to the floor . It 's not as strong of a book in terms of plotting as the first , but it does pull things together nicely , setting up what will hopefully be a fitting conclusion to the Riftwar Cycle .","book, book--world-ending cliffhanger, book--plot, book--tale, book--tangential adventures","Mixed, Positive, Mixed, Positive, Positive",,

The book had some flaws though . It needed a much better editor to go over it with a fine tooth comb . There were quite a few words missing , sentences had to be reread to make sure I understood what was meant . As well as some mix up with Pug and Magnus . But for all that I loved it .

Introduction of new character ( Rider ) adds to the potential reveal that is about to come in Magician 's End . Although that signals the end of a wonderful story line , the story itself has gotten more complex over time . Even remembering who is from where is starting to take some rereading of prior books to eliminate any confusion . Rated only 3 stars because of the numerous typos and other printing errors in the book . Often you just infer by the story what the sentence means or what was meant to be the correct word .

"The other reviews have more than adequately covered the errors . It 's hard to imagine that anyone proofread this book . Anyone posing as an editor for this volume should apologize to Feist , apologize to his readers , and return any pay that they received for the job . But it 's not that bad . You can understand what Feist is saying at all times from the context . It just looks like a draft copy from time to time . Aside from switching two characters in a particular setting and momentarily confusing the identity of another , the errors do not affect the story . If this is your first time reading Feist , do n't start with this volume . You 'll be confused for reasons other than the errors . If you are up-to-speed on the Riftwar Cycle , these errors will annoy you but they wo n't change the story . And it is a very good story . I 've read every published book in the cycle . Nothing will compare to the early volumes . There were some lows and then there were some highs . And then we about hit rock bottom with The Demonwar Saga . But the Chaoswar Saga had a good first volume . And this book is a worthy second volume . It 's a page-turner . You really want to see what happens next . The various stories flow well and produce that sense of intrigue that Feist 's best work does so well . I 'm a fanatic and I 've been letdown before . This book is not a letdown . I really like it . Be forewarned ( as other reviews have noted ) , this book sets up Magician 's End and you will not be particularly satisfied with the ending without keeping this in mind . We wo n't know until the final volume , but I think that some of the reviewers here are blowing the events at the end out of proportion . I anticipate that a great deal will be revealed soon . I ca n't wait . But please , Mr .  Feist , light a fire under someone at Harper Voyager and make them do their jobs . This is not how a publishing company survives in the age of electronic books and self-publishing . You surely have enough clout to make it happen . I 'm sad to see the Riftwar Cycle ending , but there are plenty of new fantasy writers that deserve a proper editor .

Still , familiar adversaries and a few twists keep this an interesting read for fans . Here 's hoping that Tomas actually gets seriously involved for the last book .","read--familiar adversaries, read, twists","Positive, Positive, Positive",,
"I really enjoyed this book , but I found a big problem with the writing/editing of it . I believe that Raymond E. Feist somehow swapped two of the characters ( Pug and Magnus ) for an entire chapter . In Chapter 4 page 77-101 the characters Pug , Amirantha , and Sandreena are exploring the home island of the Pantathians ( snake people ) . The chapter ends with a smallish cliff-hanger : Pug took only a single step outside : confronting him was a completely unexpected sight . Six tall pillars of light in a diamond configuration stood in the middle of the garden . From each a faint humming , almost musical , could be heard .  ` Sven-ga\'ri , \ ' said Pug . The reader next sees Pug in Chapter 6 from page 138-144 on Stardock Island with no explanation to what happened with the Pantathians . Actually here I thought I\ 'd screwed up , as at the end of the chapter Pug explains that he\ 's sending Magnus to the island to check it out , something I skipped when I was reading . However , when I continued examining the book , I realized that it was possible that the little part in chapter 6 was added to try to make sense of the mix up earlier . So I\ 'll continue , the next time we go back to the Pantathian Island it seems to pick off right where the 4th chapter ended in Chapter 15 page 308 .  : Light exploded . The blinding display was accompanied by a thunderous boom that caused both Amirantha and Sandreena to flinch and fall back a step . Magnus stood outlined in the brilliance of an oval of light that had formed before him , his hand in front of his face , shielding his eyes . To me , this reads as the follow-up to the previous cliffhanger , especially since there is no set up , and this is actually the first time we see Magnus in the book . A little after the previous quote , Magnus teleports Amirantha and Sandreena to the Academy so they can inform Pug about what\ 's been happening on the Island of Snake-Men . This in itself was strange , but then it gets even stranger when they talk to Pug and he has no idea what had happened previously on the Pantathian home Island . On page 319 : \'We found Pantathians , Pug , but unlike any we\ 've met before according to Magnus . \ ' ` Really ? \ ' said Pug leaning back in his chair . ` At this point nothing should surprise me , but say on . \ ' Amirantha explains a little bit about the Pantathians here , but then he continues by explaining the story from the beginning to Pug , the person that was with him the entire time : \'Demons ? \ ' ` Let me start at the beginning . \ ' Amirantha began , briefly telling of their travels to the Isle of the Snake Men , then in detail after the battle with the demons . \ ' Why would Pug need to be told about the entire adventure on the Pantathian Island when he himself was there ? If as the few sentence said , he was there but then came back and sent his son Magnus in his stead , Pug would instead only need an update about what happened after he left . A little bit later in this chapter Pug teleports to the Pantathian Island to join his son Magnus in studying the Sven-ga\'ri construct . Here Pug meets the Snake-Men leader on page 327 : \'You are Pug . \ ' the Pantathian said .  ` You are Tak\'ka , \ ' returned Pug .  ` It would be false should I say you are welcome here , but we understand that your son\ 's appearance and now yours are fated and accept that . It is obvious from this quote that this is the first time that these characters have met , yet they previously met on page 93 : \'Well , then we have a great deal to discuss ; until a few weeks ago , we were ignorant of them . Please , follow me . I am Tak\'ka , elected Autarch of Pantathia . \ ' He and his two companions turned and led Pug and his companions deeper into the city . From the quotes that I listed previously , I have concluded that when Feist was writing the book , he mistakenly wrote Pug into Magnus\ ' role in exploring the Island of Snake-Men . The editors later noticed the problem , but were too lazy to actually fix it as it wouldn\'t just be a name switch ; the character in chapter 4 WAS Pug , not Magnus with the wrong name . So instead they included a paragraph in Pug\ 's actual story at Stardock where he says he\ 's going to get Magnus to teleport over to Pantathia since he\ 's busy trying to convince the Sorceror\ 's council about the coming threat of the Dread ( Read this with air quotes : Yes , Reapers ) . The editors just thought that no one would notice or care , but I at least did and it bothered the hell out of me until I could figure it out . This isn\'t the only case of sloppy or lazy editing , as this book has probably the most amount of spell-check errors I\ 've ever seen in a published book . There were hundreds of instances of misspelled words that spell real other words , misused plurals/singulars , and general grammar problems . I really can\'t blame Raymond E. Feist too much , as I really liked this book . It still does feel a little inconsequential , with it really just setting up the next book , but I loved multiple parts of it . My favorite storyline was probably with Hal , Ty , Gabriella , and Stephane , it was one of the smaller parts of the book but I just really enjoyed the action and interplay between the characters . I don\'t know if the one book a year schedule is just too tight to properly edit a book , or if the editors just don\'t take pride in their work . Nonetheless , for the next book Feist needs some new editors and/or beta readers .","book--action, book--misspelled words, book, book--grammar problems, book--writing/editing, book--editing, book--editors, book--storyline, book--spell-check errors, book--misused plurals/singulars, between the characters","Positive, Negative, Mixed, Negative, Negative, Negative, Negative, Positive, Negative, Negative, Positive",,

"Harper Collins Publisher and the author advises that there are known fundamental defects in the hardback book . The paperback edition will be \'corrected\ ' in 2013 making this expensive hard back a kind of trial run . The Amazon offering does not alert the perspective buyer to the defects . I would like to think that Amazon doesn\'t know about it . Ok ... good to know after I finished this semi-edited narrative . But ... what chapter is incorrect ? The book repetitively jumps track . Discontinuities of rather epic proportions emerge . A wholly new and unknown backstory and character set sweeps over Midkemia to conclude this 2 book saga and offers a full dose of the meaninglessness of existence . It\ 's rather like reading 400 pages about the life of ants in an anthill that ends with a bucket of gasoline poured on the nature story by a nasty unknown kid .

"As always the story is entertaining and the action brisk . One problem that I had was that there have been so many books over such a long period that I sometimes forget the relationships and the past events and politics . Maybe I should re-read the old ones or hope for a guide to Midkemia . Maybe there should be more background provided in each volume . What is unforgivable in this volume is the poor proofreading . British spelling is used throughout ( the books are published in the UK first but they forgot to change to American spelling for the US release ) . A couple times the wrong word is used ( I mean you no hard instead of harm , I never told anyhow else instead of anyone . ) . Lots of commas are after the wrong word , are missing , or should be periods or semicolons . Sometimes punctuation is inside quotes ( US usage ) and sometimes outside ( UK usage ) . There are apostrophes where there should not be ( it\ 's , king\ 's ) . I had to read a few pages twice to make sense of some statements , sometimes unsuccessfully . The biggest goof is that the author changed his mind about which character should be in a situation but forgot to make it consistent .

"Farewell Kabul ( Hang em High ! ) Two corpses dangling from a lamp post . Ill never forget that sight . It was September 1996 in Kabul , Afghanistan . Former Communist ruler Najibullah and an aide were strung up after the Taleban captured the city . The pair looked like wax dummies . Najibullah had blood stains on his face and clothing . Money was hanging from his pockets and cigarettes were jammed in between his fingers . These were said to be symbols of corruption . I was reporting for Voice of America at the time . So why did America enter a no-win war in the graveyard of empires as Afghanistan is known ? The Afghans spit out a Russian army in 1989 and swallowed an entire British Army one-century-and-a-half before . Veteran British Journalist Christina Lamb has a good breakdown of what happened in Farewell Kabul From Afghanistan to a More Dangerous World . Her take after spending two-and-a-half decades as a foreign correspondent , large parts of that in Afghanistan and Pakistan . American , British , and Pakistani generals give us the story along with then-Afghan President Hamid Karzai . Lamb even survives an ambush with a British army patrol to get the infantrymans point of view . The folly of death and destruction has many players . Lamb breaks down the beginnings of the jihadist movement that is now ripping up the Mideast and even reached across the Atlantic to America on 9/11 . You can see the layers of wrong decisions and poor judgment pile up until things go critical . Its a tragedy of errors . America is betrayed by an ally , Pakistan , that harbored forces killing U.S. troops in Afghanistan . In one case , she reports a Pakistani soldier shot an American officer to death in Pakistan , though the incident was whitewashed at the time . Of course Pakistan sheltered Americas number one public enemy , Osama bin Laden , for years . Lamb fills in the details of a blundering policy that saw America drawn into a vortex of death and destruction . She shows how vast amounts of U.S. aid were funneled through Pakistani intelligence to the most radical , anti-western jihadist factions in Afghanistan to defeat the Russians . A policy that turned Pakistani madrassas into breeding grounds for jihadist killers , a trend that eventually came back to sting the United States , and even Pakistan itselfLamb also gets up close and personal with the beleaguered Hamid Karzai , who was Afghan President after the initial defeat of the Taleban . Karzai was once the darling of Washington but fell out of favor when he could not deliver . He became isolated , confined to his palace for security reasons . He kept a family of pet deer in Kabul and was proud of his collection of English poetsKeats , Poe , Shelley and Tennyson . He resented being called the mayor of Kabul , a slur suggesting he did not rule over the whole country . I interviewed Karzai a couple of times in Pakistan in the mid-1990s . He was articulate and well informed . I did not imagine he would become President of Afghanistan . If you want to get a pretty good idea of what went wrong , this is the book for you . Lamb began her journalistic odyssey innocently enough . She first went to Pakistan in 1987 as a 21-year-old correspondent for Benazir Bhuttos wedding . That life-cycle ended when Bhutto was killed in a suicide bombing and shooting attack almost 20 years later . It kind of sums up the way things go in that part of the world . What a sad state of affairs . So why did America stick its hand into the hornets nest ?","book--details of a blundering policy, book--Lamb, book, Its","Positive, Positive, Positive, Negative",,

"Afghanistan and the nations that surround it have puzzled the world for centuries . Superpowers and their best efforts have come undone in this backward and mountainous region . With this in mind , Christina Lamb has written a superb book that attempts to gather together all the moving parts and provide some clarity . The result is a masterpiece . Farewell Kabul draws upon Lambs own experiences as a foreign correspondent to the region gleaned over a twenty five year period . She was very much a direct witness to a region that seemed determined to plumb new depths of despair . Her accounts are vivid and leave the reader despairing . This is a region that seems destined for a long time in hell . Yet , for all the clarity that Lamb provides , I was constantly drawn to ask why the outside world continues to intervene . The British fought two failed wars in Afghanistan in the 19th century but this did nothing to dim the hopes of the Soviet Union in the late 20th century . It similarly did nothing to dim the efforts of the United States to support those forces fighting against the Russians . Indeed , Lamb states that by 1986 , the CIA was spending 70 % of its entire operations budget to fund a Muslim jihad to kill Russians . Talk about as you sow so shall you reap ! After 9/11 , the US got involved directly along with a number of partners . These nations are still trying to finally extricate themselves from the larger regional mess today . The cost to the West in terms of money and personnel has been stupendous . The cost to the Afghan civilian population has been even more frightening . I can not recommend this book highly enough to any reader looking for a work that ties together so many of the loose ends in Afghanistan . Christina Lamb has produced a great piece of journalistic prose . It almost reads like a thriller at times . Read it . You will not be disappointed .","journalistic prose, journalistic prose--accounts","Mixed, Mixed",,
"The author was in Afghanistan about the same time as I was..but , completely different experiences . But , that said , the summary of opinions about the sustainment of peace and security in Afghanistan is in concert with my own views ... at that time . Afghanistan will never accept western metrics..remember , the country is called..The Islamic Republic of Afghanistan . Therefore , voting in a democratic election , women\ 's right ( the right of young boys in particular ) will never change regardless of how many bad guys we kills ... and we killed alot of them , too ! In short , a summary from reporter\ 's standpoint . But , I did enjoy reading the book as several insights validated my own..and that was 2003-4 . What a waste of our people and billions of US taxpayer money .",book,Positive,,
"If you 're going to publish a book this thick and arcane to most readers , you better write well and have lots to say . Lamb does both , giving us a fascinating account that is unlike any other . Although this brave reporter must have drawn heavily from her articles and notes , the book is more than a collection dusted off for publication . She writes that she never posted her magnificent portrait of Karzai for fear it would make him seem ( while still President ) a madman ! Theres a narrative flow , an objective we feel ourselves moving toward . She writes with passion , empathy , emotion , and a controlled fury based on facts and personal observations . She facilitates our passage with anecdotes , experiences , and conversations with players big and small . She seems on target in Afghanistan and Pakistan , though this Brit sometimes misses the mark in the U.S. , most notably ( and inexplicably ) when she fails to recognize that Bud McFarlane was National Security Advisor , instead labeling him an ex-CIA agent . And although some may view this as a quibble , the U.S. Congress authorized war in 1991 but the U.S. did not declare war , as the book states . Also , in a chapter about the Afghan presidential election in October 2004 , she writes that Saddam Hussein had been been executed ( didnt happen until the end of 2006 ) . Further afield , she attributes all U.S. combat deaths in Vietnam to the Viet Cong guerillas when the North Vietnamese Army may have killed more . Decent maps and great photos , many in color , though I wish another had been chosen for the cover ( got tired of that soldiers stare ) .

"It is difficult to even imagine the stacks of reports , articles , notes and interviews that Dr .  Mukherjee processed to produce this fabulous book . Each page explains , in very readable prose , complex , arcane subjects . For anyone looking for reason to hope that their cancer is curable , this book is trove of stories of lives saved and changed by the work of cancer researchers . This book will be referenced in other works for a long time .","book--Each page, book, book--subjects","Positive, Mixed, Negative",,
"As a work of scholarship , this book is just tremendous . Mukherjee traces the history of our understanding of cancer from 2500 BC to present-day . He writes of political battles for public attention , incredible wiles in the biology of the disease , and schisms among the researchers sent to conquer it . All major developments are present and sourced in sixty pages of footnotes . From this grand historical scope , Mukherjee has crafted a tight and coherent narrative that I found very difficult to put down . I\ 'm aware of no lay account of cancer with anything approaching the level of depth present here . This book is unique . Like anything so vast , it isn\'t quite perfect . Certain structural changes would benefit fluency , though they\ 've no impact on my recommendation . * More humanizing characteristics and quotations . Smaller researchers , and occasionally even key players , are summed by little more than what they\ 've accomplished . There are perhaps a hundred contributors that Mukherjee covers , but with exception to a handful that have had tens of pages devoted to them or some peculiar eccentricity , they\ 're interchangeable and unmemorable . * A more even balance between discovery and those stricken by cancer . Mukherjee is at his best when he\ 's describing the struggles of his own patients . These stories are touching , personal , and an intensely interesting ground-level foil to the bird\ 's eye view of much of the book . The retrospective of cancer discovery is so vast and detailed that these rare moments where the story reverts to the present can feel like an oasis . Roughly half of The Emperor is comprised of five and ten-page vignettes where Mukherjee poses a question ( If XY , then could XYZ ... ? ) and resolves it with the travails of a researcher ( Person Q , a scientist at H , noticed ... ) . These accounts are often gripping , especially as advances accelerate in the mid-1980s , but sets of four or five in a series are enough to cause my attention to drift . * A different ending . In the final chapters , Mukherjee suggests he\ 'd originally intended to conclude with the death of a particular patient . By serendipity , that patient was still living in late 2009 . Given the great strides in cancer survival and the sense he conveys that genetics may well provide the magic bullets that so occupied the fantasies of early researchers , concluding on a high note would have been within the spirit of the book . Instead , Mukherjee describes another patient who did in fact die . This person was not previously introduced . She was a better fit for the narrative , but including her account for that purpose didn\'t strike the right tone to me . I\ 'd also like to have seen Mukherjee become more of a prognosticator in later chapters . There probably aren\'t a hundred people alive in a better position than the author to comment on the state of cancer research , to predict , or to theorize in new directions . Such insights are spare in The Emperor . Having so aptly dispensed with past and present , it left me wanting for more about the future . These notes aside , if you\ 've even a tangential interest in cancer or biology , Mukherjee\ 's opus remains a must-read .","Mukherjee\ 's opus--quotations, Mukherjee\ 's opus--account, Mukherjee\ 's opus--stories, Mukherjee\ 's opus--structural changes, Mukherjee\ 's opus, Mukherjee\ 's opus--retrospective of cancer discovery, Mukherjee\ 's opus--characteristics, Mukherjee\ 's opus--accounts, Mukherjee\ 's opus--narrative","Positive, Mixed, Positive, Positive, Mixed, Positive, Positive, Positive, Positive",,
"Siddhartha Mukherjee\ 's monumental The Emperor of All Maladies meticulously outlines the trajectory of cancer ( derived from the Greek word karkinos , meaning crab ) over thousands of years , starting in ancient Egypt . In 2010 , seven million people around the world will die of cancer . Many have experienced the horrors of this disease through personal experience . The author provides us with a global view of this shape-shifting entity [ that is ] imbued with such metaphorical and political potency that it is often described as the definitive plague of our generation . In The Emperor of All Maladies , we meet a variety of patients , doctors , scientists , and activists . We also hear the voices of such iconic figures as Susan Sontag , author of Illness as Metaphor , and Alexander Solzhenitsyn , whose Cancer Ward is a desolate and isolating medical gulag . Cancer is such a complex subject that it can only be understood by examining it in all of its facets : through myths , the anguish of its victims , and the untiring efforts of its adversaries , both past and present , some of whom were well-meaning but horribly misguided . Mukherjee says in his author\ 's note that he has made an effort to be simple but not simplistic . In this he has succeeded . Ancient physicians thought that such invisible forces as miasmas and bad humors caused cancers . Many years of experimentation , studies of human anatomy , laboratory work , and clinical trials have shown cancer to be a pathology of excess that originates from the uncontrolled growth of a single cell . Cancer is unleashed by mutations -- changes in DNA that specifically affect genes that incite unlimited cell growth . What treatment to use -- surgery , radiation , chemotherapy , or a combination of these approaches -- is rarely an easy decision . Equally significant are the efforts of public health officials , who seek to reduce cancer\ 's mortality through early detection ( mammography and colonoscopy , among others , are screening methods in use today ) . In addition , cancer may be prevented by encouraging people to avoid environmental carcinogens such as cigarette smoke . This elegant and heartrending narrative is far more than a biography of a terrible malady . It is also a story of paternalism , arrogance , and false hope , as well as inventiveness , determination , and inspiration . We meet Sidney Farber , who pioneered a chemotherapeutic approach to leukemia in children during the 1940\ 's and helped launch the Jimmy Fund ; William Halstead who , in the nineteenth century , disfigured women with radical mastectomies that , in many cases , were not curative ; Paul Ehrlich , who discovered a magic bullet to combat syphilis from a derivative of chemical dyes ; Mary Lasker , a powerful businesswoman and socialite who zealously raised money and political awareness in what would become a national war on cancer ; and George Papanicolaou , a Greek cytologist , whose Pap smear changed the spectrum of cervical cancer . Mukherjee constantly moves back and forth in time , showing how the past and the present are closely interconnected . Throughout the book , Dr .  Mukherjee\ 's keeps returning to one of his patients , Carla . In 2004 , she was diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia , a cancer of the white blood cells . She would have a long road ahead of her , filled with pain , fear , and uncertainty . We look to the future with cautious optimism that even greater progress will be made in our never-ending battle against a treacherous and multi-pronged enemy . Mukherjee is a brilliant oncologist , gifted writer , scrupulous researcher , and spellbinding storyteller . The Emperor of All Maladies is a riveting , thought-provoking , and enlightening work that deserves to become an instant classic .","Emperor of All Maladies--Mukherjee, Emperor of All Maladies--story, Emperor of All Maladies, Emperor of All Maladies--narrative","Positive, Negative, Mixed, Negative",,
"There seems little left to say so I 'll take a different tack , look to another facet of this book and its author . Today I heard Dr .  Mukherjee interviewed on the Terry Gross show ( Fresh Air - NPR ) , where the topic , the book , was biased in favor of the author ... and a wonderful treat it was . While I am interested in cancer and progress toward cure , the fascinating aspect of today 's experience was the man himself . In all the interviews of all the interviewers I 've listened in on - mostly literary in nature - I 've never heard a more articulate responder than Mukherjee . He 's a poet . His choice of words slice in toward meaning like the scalpel itself . He avoids vagueness and ambiguity , courts acuracy and precsion like no one I 've heard . He is a treat just to listen to , never mind his insights into the disease , it 's history and possible future . I ordered this book today in order to get more of his artistry but I would n't discourage those seeking the phycician 's prowess - that is there too . If I should be in that 25 % that ends up with cancer , I would hope Dr .  Mukherjee would be there to consult with me and console .",book,Positive,,
"**I am pleased that Dr .  Mukherjee has won the Pulitzer prize in general non fiction for this book , 4-18-11In the United States one in three women and one in two men will develop cancer in their lifetime . Dr Siddhartha Mukherjee , a medical oncologist , has written a definitive history of cancer . It may be one of the best medical books I have read . Complex but simple in terms of understanding . A timeline of a disease and those who waged the wars . In 1600 BC the first case of probable breast cancer was documented . In the thousands of years since , the Greek word , \'onkos\ ' , meaning mass or burden , has become the disease of our time . Cancer . The title of the book , is a quote from a 19Th century physician Dr Mukherjee had found inscribed in a library book that cancer is the emperor of all maladies , the king of our terrors . As a health care professional and as a woman who is six years post breast cancer , Cancer has played a big part in my life . I used to walk by the Oncology clinic , and quicken my pace . I used to give chemotherapy to my patients , before it was discovered that the chemo was so toxic that it needed to be made under sterile conditions and given by professionals who specialized in Oncology . Dr Mukherjee , wisely discusses cancer in the context of patients , those of us who suffer . After all it is because of the patients , the people who have gone before us , who have contracted some form of cancer , they are the base of this science . Dr Mukherjee started his immersion in cancer medicine at the Dana Farber Cancer Institute in Boston . He relates the beginning of the study of ALL , Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia , by Dr Sidney Farber in 1947 . Dr Farber , a pathologist at the time decided to change his focus and start caring for patients . He was given a medication to trial for ALL , and though most of his patients died , some survived to remission . This opened his world and with the help of Mary Lasker , and Charles E Dana , philanthropists , they opened one of the first clinics that specialized in cancer care and research , The Dana Farber Cancer Center . Dr Mukherjee gives us the timeline of ALL and lymphomas and the medications that turned into chemotherapy . The development of specific care for blood cancers and the emergence of AIDS and patient activism . He discusses the surgery for breast cancer . It was thought that the more radical the surgery the better the outcomes . We now know that lumpectomies have an excellent outcome . But , women before me had a radical removal of breast , chest tissue , lymph nodes and sometimes ribs . The lesson learned is that breast cancer is very curable now and all those men and women , the patients who suffered , gave us the answers and cancer care has moved on . The onslaught of chemotherapies changed the face of cancer , and the 1970\ 's served us well . In 1986 the first outcomes of cancer care were measured . Tobacco emerged as an addiction and soon lung cancer was a leading cause of death . Presidential Commissions ensued , politics entered the world of cancer , the war against cancer and the war against smoking . The Pap smear was developed , and prevention came to the fore . The two sides of cancer , the researchers and the physicians at the bedside , who often thought never the twain shall meet , recognized the importance of research to bedside . The story of the boy \'Jimmy\ ' from New Sweden , Maine , became the face of childhood cancer . The Jimmy Fund , a Boston Red Sox charity in Boston , is still going strong today . \'Jimmy\ ' opened the door to the public for the need for money and research , and care for those with cancer . We follow Dr Mukherjee with one of his first patients , Carla , from her diagnosis through her treatment . He has given a face to cancer . We all know someone with cancer , those who survived and those who did not . Cancer prevention is now the wave of the future . Cancer is and may always be part of the burden we carry with us , says Dr Mukherjee . He has now written a biography of cancer for us , those without special medical knowledge . However , he does go astray in some discussions such as genetics . I have an excellent medical background , and found I was floundering at times . As I discovered , and Dr .  Mukherjee agrees , our patients are our heroes . They/we withstand the horrors of cancer , and the horrific , sometimes deadly treatments . The stories of his patients make us weep , and the complex decision making about their care make him the most caring of physicians . The \'quest for the cure\ ' is the basis of all science and research , and Dr Mukherjee has written a superb tome in language that we can all attempt to understand . The biography of Cancer . Cancer may always be with us , Dr Mukherjee hopes that we outwit this devil and survive .

"You remember the scene in the film Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid ? From the top of the bluff looking into the distance at dusk , Butch sees the lights of the pursuing posse which doesn\'t stop tracking them even at night and says How many are following us ? They\ 're beginning to get on my nerves . Who are those guys ? In the same threatening way cancers have been dogging human beings since the dawn of time , and although we now know quite a lot about cancer we still don\'t really know who are those guys or how to shake them . And they sure are beginning to get on our nerves as Butch said . Almost one out of four of us will eventually wrestle with cancer -- the defining illness of our generation -- and lose our lives in the process . Until it catches up with us most of us will try to ignore this fact , just as when we were very young children alone in our bedroom trying to go to sleep at night we tried to ignore the monster that we sometimes feared might be lurking in our bedroom closet . Enter oncologist Siddhartha Mukherjee who almost parentally takes us by the hand to give us the courage to open with him the door to that dark and foreboding closet in order to see what is really lurking inside . Since eventually most of us are going to have to wrestle with this monster anyway -- either as a victim or as a loved one of a victim -- looking intelligently and closely into that dark closet does diminish fear and enhance wise perspective . And on this incredible journey into the depths of that darkness , what an absolutely marvelous guide is this modern day Virgil called Siddharta Mukherjee as he leads us on this long and often harrowing journey through the swarth that cancer has cut through mankind throughout time . Mukherjee is a veritable kaleidoscope . Turn his writing one way and you experience him as an exciting writer of page-turning detective stories or mystery stories ; turn him another and he\ 's a highly effective communicator of cellular biology ; turn him a third and you get superb science writing ; turn him a fourth and he has the grandeur and broad sweep of an excellent historian . It\ 's hard to believe that this one book , combining all of these appealing characteristics , is the work of just one man . And underlying it all is his sterling medical training and credentials which have been enumerated often elsewhere . The book itself is a tour de force . It is the first book of such extraordinary scope regarding cancer . Its architectural structure brings to mind Melville\ 's Moby Dick and how effectively and artfully Melville braided together the three strands of his great classic : a grand adventure story , the technology of whaling , and a treatise of humanity and philosophy . Equally effectively does Mukherjee weave together all the various facets of this iconic disease throughout history , from describing cancer from the patient\ 's perspective , to viewing the never ending battles of physicians and medical researchers with cancer over the centuries , to examining the mysteries of the cellular nature of cancer itself and what really goes on in there , to the pro and con impact of this never ending plague on the spirit of the individual human and on our race as a whole , to peering into a crystal ball for a glance of cancer\ 's and our future together . While doing all of this the alchemy of Mukherjee\ 's writing continually turns science into poetry and poetry into science . Simply put , it is so good , and so incandescently clear and lucid , and so powerful , and so engrossing , and so easily consumed that you will not lay it down without someone or circumstances forcing you to . Had I read this book in my teens I would have found my life\ 's career . I can only imagine that while you are reading this book , somewhere there will be some very young teenage girl or boy who will also be reading it at the same time you are , and who will become totally hooked by this book just as you will be , and who will go on to make a career in cancer research , a career that might provide the breakthrough that humanity has been searching and hoping for all of these many centuries . Thus although you will never know it , you will have been there at the initial motivation of that person and thus indirectly present at the earliest genesis of the eventual great idea . This book has THAT potential . It is THAT good . Kenneth E. MacWilliams","book--Siddharta Mukherjee, book, book--Its architectural, book--Mukherjee\ 's writing","Positive, Positive, Positive, Positive",,

"This is a truly remarkable book . I am not sure I have ever come across anything quite like it . Dr .  Mukherjee combines aspects of a memoir , biography , history and science in this biography of cancer . I see several of the reviews are from readers who picked up the book after starting cancer treatment and found it helpful . But it seems to me the book offers more of a care taker\ 's perspective on the disease . I feel like doctors should have to read this book to get a medical license . The author is in command of the subject matter , and yet humbled by it . He details the history of cancer and its often ghastly treatment and introduces the reader to several of his patients as he tracks their fight with the disease . A bibliographical section at the end lists several books which influenced the other , among them Susan Sontag\ 's Illness as Metaphor , which he cites several times in the text . But there was another , Richard Rhodes\ ' masterpiece , The Making of the Atomic Bomb , which puzzled me at first . However , on reflection , I realized that each of these books explains extremely complicated science , makes the process feel real , not academic and tells the history behind the subject . Highly recommended to anyone who has been or may be impacted by cancer . ( That\ 's everybody . )","book--author, book","Positive, Positive",,

"The Emperor of All Maladies : A Biography of Cancer by Siddhartha Mukherjee covers the vast and myriad history of cancer including much of the development of medicine over the centuries . Mukherjee introduces cancer in terms of both its effects on humans and its resilience . He illuminates the path the myriad of treatments have taken over the years reminding the reader that science and medicine require much determination and a willingness to follow through and change direction as the research points in new directions . The Emperor of All Maladies reminds the reader of the benefits of working across borders and cultures to find answers . The history of cancer is rather dark and even eerie at times but leaves one feeling a grudging respect for its tenacity . Mukherjee explains how it adapts to human beings attempts to eradicate it . As Mukherjee draws direct lines between researchers and research findings from around the world that have brought us to where we are today in the treatment of cancer , he reminds us that cooperation often benefits us all more than isolation does . The Emperor of All Maladies puts cancer under the microscope for anyone whose life has been affected by cancer or might someday be affected by cancer , directly or indirectly .",Emperor of All Maladies,Positive,,
"A beautifully written , fascinating , well researched , and , ultimately , sobering look at cancer . I bought this book because I have recently been diagnosed with breast cancer . I wanted a deeper understanding of cancer than I could find on the usual cancer websites patients are directed to . This book delivered in spades . It delves into the history of cancer - our understanding of it and treatment through the ages . It goes into the biology of cancer and how scientists have come to understand more about it . It talks about recent advances in treatment and how they were discovered and brought to market . Most importantly , the author does it all with an amazing sense of the impact on individuals affected by cancer . He is a medical oncologist who tells the stories of his patients ' battles with cancer . It 's a fascinating story told with so much humanity and so much humility . He makes very clear what a devastating disease this is , how complex it is , and what a wily opponent cancer is . As a cancer patient I wanted a deeper understanding of cancer , and I got it .

"I bought this book because I did n't understand much of anything about cancer , and I really wanted to ( and still want to ) understand the basics . What is cancer ? How does it metastasize ? What is it like to face this illness ? What is it like to be a doctor treating these patients ? Etc . Instead this is a book about the fumbling missteps of doctors throughout history in trying various remedies , none of which worked . Instead of telling me what cancer is , I instead was told what the weather was like in Boston in 1947 . After 100 pages , I still had none of my questions answered and I gave up on the book . I did flip through it ... and hundreds of pages later I was still seeing stories about someone 's dark lab in 1920 or a paper from 1910 . I really would like a comprehensible description of what cancer is , how it works , what the best treatments are , how doctor 's approach this .

"Last April I was diagnosed with acute leukaemia . After a stem cell transplant I am coming up for a year . When you are told you have cancer you are bewildered . You are also very angry . I asked myself was there something I had done in my past that was going to deprive me seeing my two sons grow up into happy young men and dads . The first two weeks go by in a weird nightmare . Day 17 your hair falls out . Your peeing orange from the chemo drugs , which have put me off lucozade for life . You double check all your insurances are up to date and update a well to make sure my wife does not have any hassles with the tax authorities . At the age of 44 you are very angry . You realise you are likely going to die . You are angry because you have no idea what is doing it . What you planned for when you were older is all meaningless . But , thanks to certain stubbornness and amazing treatment and care , and a generous sift of life from a German donor of life giving stem cells , I am alive . This book helps explain many of the questions I had . It does it in a way that makes sense if you do n't have a degree in science . What was until recently a death sentence is no longer the case . The battle against cancer was waged by intrepid individuals , and this book explains the war so far . It outlines the causes of cancer , whether it is a virus , bacteria , induced by smoking or chemicals , or just our own body playing up and turning on itself . It explains how our own understanding is still basic but advancing year by year , and treatments , if not cures , are being found for many , although not all cancers . I learned that was once a death sentence is not the case today . I am looking forward to see my sons become men . This book gave me clarity , it gave me hope .",book,Positive,,

"The Emperor of all Maladies ( EM ) is more a history of cancer but the subtitle A Biography of Cancer was intelligently chosen as biography is less off-putting than history . Also , biography , or fictional biography as I call it , is one of the two genres of books that Americans , even those who do not read books , end up reading in their lifetimes . We do get a fairly comprehensive history of cancer . Cancer here means cancer in all its aspects : how humans started to recognize and describe its signs in the dead over time ( Part 1 . ) The human aspect -- we learn a bit about a few cancer patients , but also about the physicians , scientists , researchers involved . There\ 's the scientific aspect which Siddhartha Mukherjee ( SM ) manages to distill to a very non-scientific non-threatening account . There\ 's the activist/political aspect ( Part 2 ) . Cancer had to be politicized at some point when the people had to alert the lame politicians Hey , there\ 's a disease killing scores of Americans and we don\'t know what it\ 's about , you may want to look into this . Or when it was established that tobacco smoke causes respiratory cancers and the lame politicians ( aka recipients of tobacco industry donations ) had to be coaxed into at least letting smokers know that they are filling their lungs with carcinogens . SM writes in a very American way , so of course money can\'t be left out and he devotes several chapter to cancer funding . With such a rich and comprehensive account no doubt some issues will be more or less interesting to some readers . I personally didn\'t care much for the the financial/advocacy chapters . My interest is more in the science , history , and the future . Whether EM is truly comprehensive is debatable I guess . I am in no position to argue one way or the other but some Amazon reviewers have pointed out all the figures that have been left out . SM himself addresses those criticism in the interview at the end of the book . That doesn\'t take away that this book seems to be comprehensive as we meet hundreds of people involved in the fight against cancer . Some of these make appearances throughout the book , others are mentioned once and never again . For each , SM comes up with a triad of descriptors to characterize their personality . Most of them are focused , determined , etc .  -- traits that are useful when dealing with something new and working against some current . But these same characteristics have also been responsible for the medical excesses related to cancer treatment . One way you can tell EM is well-written is that you truly end up despising the villains in this book . And cancer isn\'t the only villain here . Some physicians and researchers set aside all common and medical sense and crossed the line -- by a good margin -- in their attempts to kill cancer . We learn how the two weapons against cancer -- surgery and chemotherapy were enthusiastically taken to the extreme ( Part 3 . ) Humans suffer from an insatiable drive to the ever-more . Physicians are no different . Surgeons sought to fight cancer by extirpating ever more tissue/organs from patients . Others sought to poison cancer once and for all by treating patients with ever higher and more toxic doses of chemicals . This reaches its crescendo with a vile therapy meant to kill the patient\ 's bone marrow and thus the patient . The patient is then revived with a bone-marrow transplant so the physicians can continue to administer yet more poison . This was driven by the reverence to a researcher who claimed to have astonishing cure rates . Physicians were easily deceived and succumbed to the blind hope of success by this method , which turned out to be a farce and the researcher unmasked as a charlatan . One physician who fell head first into this is one William Peters who studied biochemistry , biophysics , and philosophy and then obtained an MD/PhD . I\ 'm not going to say he should have known better because , as we will see , when it comes to cancer , knowledge might not apply . But Peters had the intellectual tools to at least question what he was getting himself into , or rather , to what he was subjecting his patients . I single him out because it is a depressing story for those of us who believe that education actually makes a difference . There are heroes here too , such as George Papanicolaou , whose story is downright tear-inducing . While the medical community was worshiping at the altar of the transplant charlatan , Papanicolaou was up to something and he was right from the beginning . But the medical community wasn\'t interested in the least . The War on Cancer then is also a story of few successes and lots of failures , many unavoidable , many avoidable . It\ 's a story of the universality of human error from which no one is exempt -- not even those with giant egos and/or lots of money/prestige . Like all Wars On ... , the war on cancer is also characterized by spectacular waste of time , resources , energy . Eventually , like everything else in America , not only did it become politicized/monetized but ultimately financialized . We learn how medications with a very high probability of acting as a cure are not released because corporations are more concerned with numbers ( and the FDA with safety ) . More frightening , pharmaceutical transnationals are sitting on hundreds of compounds that may serve some purpose . Will we ever see them put to good use ? I wouldn\'t bet on it . Cancer then is a formidable enemy and its greatest allies are ... we -- just as with the other Wars On ... War seems like an appropriate term . We adopt a method , cancer adapts , responds to the challenge by switching strategies . It\ 's not a war that will see victory . Yet , it\ 's also an inappropriate term . We\ 're dealing with a protracted , perhaps endless series of battles . At any one point one can freeze the action and draw an account as to who has the upper hand . The next moment , it may be different . Cancer is in motion , it\ 's not a static disease . And here comes our main challenge . One lesson of EM is that we still don\'t know how to appropriately conceive of cancer . Is it a single disease ? Or is every single cancer its own disease ? Is it still useful to think of cancer as cancer of the X organ ? Or is a cancer\ 's genetics a better way to describe it ? The term cancer is still amenable to redefinition , just as so many other terms in relation to it . Cause curesurvival mortality rates , terms with which we are all familiar with had to be re-conceived which is why I think the term knowledge doesn\'t apply all too well to cancer . Rather it\ 's a matter of understanding , of perspective , of pragmatism . Which perspective is more useful to understand and fight cancer ? One lesson of the history of cancer is that the single-approach is the worst . The current standard two-pronged approach of surgery+chemotherapy will prove to be inadequate in the future as well I suspect . Cancer will have to be addressed from all angles at once and at all times . EM has 6 parts , all with several chapters . The part and chapter titles are rather useless in describing their contents . Part 4 focuses on the slow march toward identifying the causes of cancer . Once you know what the cause is then it\ 's a matter of addressing/avoiding those causes . But again , it\ 's the desire and hope for a single unitary cause that proved to be a stumbling block . One school focused on viruses another on genetics and of course these two directions didn\'t communicate with each other . Part 5 discuses these approaches . The final part 6 gives an account of where we are and looks into the future ... but not enough , that part is supplemented with the interview to the author where he specifically discusses four potentially fruitful approaches . As a popularizer of the history of cancer , The Emperor of all Maladies , is no doubt a tremendous success and a remarkable achievement .","Emperor of all Maladies--story--characteristics, Emperor of all Maladies--account, Emperor of all Maladies, Emperor of all Maladies--story--traits, Emperor of all Maladies--story, Emperor of all Maladies--A Biography of Cancer, Emperor of all Maladies--part and chapter titles, Emperor of all Maladies--story--account","Negative, Positive, Mixed, Positive, Mixed, Positive, Negative, Positive",,

Hope springs eternal as each new discovery emboldens and humbles our best efforts to understand the emperor of all maladies .

"The author of this excellent book thinks in monarchic terms . Cancer is the 'emperor ' of maladies . The historical starting point of the story is Queen Atossa , whose breast cancer also provides the theme for the book 's summary , a fast forward through the history of medical progress . A philosophical metaphor is provided by the great Red Queen : we need to run fast just to stay where we are . Progress requires running twice as fast . Ideology tends to corrupt . How does that insight relate to cancer ? Wars against cancer have been waged with big guns , but the first law of war was ignored for a long time : know your enemy . Who wants to read a 'biography of cancer ' ? Do n't we all know enough about it , be it by own direct experience , or by watching relatives and friends in their struggles ? I did n't feel much interested when this book became a non-fiction bestseller and award winner a few years ago . Something changed my mind , and I am glad . It is very good . There is a certain standard style in American non fiction , that sometimes turns me off . The writers must all have gone through the same school of 'creative writing ' . Subjects must be cut down into digestible pieces , the reader must be amused by anecdotes , almost at all cost . All this can only be tolerated when the book really has something to tell us . This one does . The manic diligence of surgeons in the early years of the 'war on cancer ' is as scary as the aggression of radiologists and chemotherapists . As is the neglect of prevention that ruled for a surprisingly long time . Much frenzy , hype , hope , and bitter disappointment has happened . The tide has possibly turned . Mortality moves down , gradually . All prongs contribute . Are we there yet ? Hardly . Geneticists are apparently making progress towards a better understanding of the biology of cancer . Some cures for specific cancers have actually been found , but the enemy keeps evolving . We need to run fast in order to stay in the same place , and even faster for progress . The red queen knew about that . The book has much to say on the politics of science and health care . The historical politicization of cancer research and therapy is striking and is one aspect that makes this book worth reading . Company decisions based on profitability , and strategy considerations do n't play as big a part in this story , as I would have expected . Anyway , better do n't catch it , even if your survival odds are getting better .","book--style, book--story, book, It","Negative, Negative, Mixed, Positive",,

"Dr .  Mukherjee describes his Pulitzer Prize winning book as a biography of cancer . If so , its like the biography of a master thief or a gangster . One reads it not because one finds the character in any way endearing , but one cant help but admire the resourcefulness and indomitable spirit of the culprit . Humanity has been at war with cancer for decades , but it remains alive and well -- losing ground in specific domains but gaining overall . The book covers a period from when our technology was too crude to see at the tiny levels necessary to recognize the commonality between various forms of cancer to the present-day attempts to find treatments that can target cancer cells without attacking good cellsa challenging prospect . The implication of that last sentence is that the cure might be as damning as the disease , and this has often proven to be the case . Its often a race to see whether the cancer can be killed before the treatment kills the patient . This has been the case with radiation , radical surgeries , and various forms of chemotherapy that are toxic to good cells as well as bad . While the book ends on a hopeful note about more targeted treatment , cancer has not gone gently into that good night . While the book covers a broad period , the bulk of its pages are devoted to the latter half of the 20th century . Thats when the war on cancer got serious and the science became advanced enough to move beyond crude approaches like radical mastectomies . Our understanding of chemistry , pharmacology , and biology reached a point at which cures were no longer pie-in-the-sky notions . But it was n't just the medical science that was more advanced , statistical methodology also reached a point at which it could answer questions that had previously been elusive . Such questions include whether smoking caused cancera fact that seems self-evident today , but which was n't as straightforward as one might think . There is also the issue of whether various treatments were actually extending the lifespans of those afflicted , which was also not as simple as one might think . While the above discussion of science and statistics might make this book seem dreadfully boring , this is n't the case . Mukherjee did n't get the 2011 Pulitzer Prize for Nonfiction by being dull . The author knows the value of a story , and uses stories successfully throughout the book . There are the stories of individual patient cases , but also the story of the mass movement to raise dollars , awareness , and Congressional support to fight cancer . These true stories sometimes show the roller coaster ride that we associate with fictionsuch as the apparent cure of a form of childhood leukemia that seemed promising until the kids once in remission started coming back with symptoms ( the leukemia crossed the brain-blood barrier and found fertile ground on the other side of a biological wall that was meant to keep such neer-do-wells out . ) As one might expect of a book that covers so much ground , its not thin . The books 600 pages are arranged in 43 chapters divided into six parts . Im sure theres a lot more one could learn about cancer , but Mukherjee covers a lot of ground in an interesting package . I wo n't say I enjoyed the book ( its unavoidably depressing , if hopeful ) but I did find it both interesting and readable . While it might not be the sunniest and most joyous of reads , its one that many people should read . Id recommend it for anyone . I would say anyone who has been touched by cancer , but I think thats the same thing at this point .","book--its pages, book, book--author, book--stories, book--culprit, book--package","Negative, Mixed, Positive, Positive, Positive, Positive",,

"Like a nut possessed I ran into the cancer clinic effused with hope over recent announcements about cancer moonshots . My wifes oncologist raised a cautious eyebrow , saying well , well see , indicating his tempered view of press releases and clinical reality . I had just finished Vincent DeVitos excellent history Death of Cancer . So you are ready for the next book ? asked her whip-smart physician , who visibly warms to the mention of T-Cells . This is it . THE EMPEROR OF ALL MALADIES . One of the best histories Ive enjoyed in some time . Siddhartha Mukherjee is the Bill Bryson of cancer . He leaves no stone unturned , navigating a fascinating landscape of this horrible disease . From the ancient Egyptians to the modern genetics laboratory , Mukherjee unfolds our roadmap to better understanding what and how humans have come to learn about cancer . He chronicles the misbegotten theories , disjointed research , the hiccups and restarts , the frustrations and paucity of reward . Cancer research has its white knights and Nobel laureates . But chiefly it has been many forgotten individuals making seemingly inconsequential discoveries that nonetheless contribute to the ever-increasing knowledgebase . In the end , Mukherjee hints at where the puzzle of cancer might be headed . The Pulitzer Prize winner navigates the fine line between technical jargon and intriguing storytelling . Five hundred pages fly by . ( Okay , except for somewhat heavy reading for laymen about genetics in the middle . ) Mukherjees rich vocabulary builds a deeply descriptive , vivid story . Testament to the accessibility , and immediacy , of his text is that Maladies has become a franchise . Mukherjee has spun out followups , TEDx talks , and a three part PBS film by documentary master Ken Burns that I am enjoying now . Mukherjee 's articulate writing , his command of a phrase , his innate ability to weave a story are brilliant . I highly recommend his masterwork to you .","masterwork--Mukherjees, masterwork--history, masterwork--story, masterwork--landscape of this horrible disease, storytelling, masterwork","Positive, Positive, Positive, Positive, Positive, Positive",,

"Review of Book and Ken Burns Series : One of the best books and also now one of the best Documentary 's out there . This is a 3 episode , three disc , exploration and history of one of the greatest mass murderers of all time , CANCER . This documentary is a thoughtful , moving , emotional journey into everything about cancer and what all the doctors , nurses , researchers and victims have gone through . Possibly one of the best , if not the best research examples ever done in written form , and now film form . I have read the book also which I highly recommend and now I highly recommended the 3 Disc Documentary that Ken Burns has created . I have never been so glued , moved , brought to tears as I have by this documentary .

Siddhartha Mukherjee is one of the finest human beings to ever grace book form , his book brought to life this horrible reality . He not only brought a face to the monster , but he allowed you to understand the history , and massive exploration for treatment and hopefully one day a cure .

"I picked the book up because I have an interest in cancer for several reasons . First , 1/3 of all humans die from cancer . Second , from a scientific perspective it is a fascinating , challenging and complex topic . This is an extremely well written , well planned out and organized book . I 'm almost as much in awe of the author 's command of the English language as I am of the skill he had in organizing the material . If anyone else were to do a history of cancer , they truly could not match the quality of this book . I say this because the author strikes a perfect balance between focusing on details when needed and focusing on the big picture when needed . And he presents the material in such a way that the key points really stick with you . You walk away with an excellent understanding of the disease - certainly much more than the layman and probably more than some medical professionals - and a comprehensive understanding of how human beings have tried , and continue to try to understand this disease . I think a lot of people should read this book . First of all to expel the myths and misunderstandings that people have about cancer . Second , to have a much better understanding of doctors and medical profession , including their limitations .

"Dr .  Mukherjee writes beautifully about the history of cancer -- how we first began to define it as a disease , how it was treated in different eras , how its incidence has grown over time , how we\ 've begun to understand the basic pathways that cancer takes , and how we are beginning to develop remarkably effective treatments for some cancers . One of the problems with this approach is the many different forms that cancer takes , and how unwieldy it is even to speak about one overarching disease . Dr .  Mukherjee acknowledges this time and again , but he also points out the remarkably small number of pathways that all cancers take in their genesis and development -- six . Also , it makes cultural sense to speak of one overarching disease . One of the most astounding themes of the book is the ways in which cancer\ 's genesis , development , and imperative of finding ways to survive mimics life itself . Cancer is a kind of alternative universe -- a competing kind of life which evolves and which can\'t be entirely stamped out just like life itself can\'t just be stamped out . Dr . Mukherjee explains with remarkable clarity the genetic and molecular basis of cancer -- how so many mutations and circumstances have to occur before it can start and grow . Because we live longer and are exposed to more carcinogens , cancer incidence continues to grow and can overwhelm the protective measures we take . Cancer is a long march , though at the end it is as rushed and overwhelming as a tidal wave . He demonstrates the recent forms of nontoxic treatments that target and control certain kinds of mutations . While the crusade to cure cancer started by the developers of chemotherapy in the 1940s and the radiation and other therapies that followed has not succeeded , survival rates are encouraging . And we have to give due regard for cancer\ 's ability to adapt and change and to resist various cures . Still , there are some kinds of cancers that have yielded to remarkably effective treatment and there are some long term survivors who can reasonably claim to have been cured . Dr . Mukherjee is also sensitive to the emotional tolls of cancer on patient and doctor alike , and to the difficult ethical issues presented to scientists trying to conduct double blind studies amidst all the suffering of those willing to try anything right now . This is a brilliant book worthy of the Pulitzer Prize .","book--Mukherjee, book, book--themes","Positive, Positive, Positive",,

"The Emperor of All Maladies is a no question a fascinating book . And it certainly merits the praise it has received . Mukherjee , however , needed a better editor . There are a number of solecisms , e.g. , careering for careening . But proof-reading aside , it badly needs some cutting . The obvious absurdity of the War on Cancer receives far to much attention , breaks the narrative flow and in my opinion constitutes one long digression.. A little too much human history . He could have learned from Paul de Kruifs classic Microbe Hunters ( still in print 90 years later ) , brevity for one . Seeing that Ken Burns has picked it up one has a slight suspicion that this was written with a TV documentary in mind so we have some drama added : it will be interesting to see how that is used . The conclusion almost seems perfunctory .","book--editor, book, book--careening","Negative, Mixed, Negative",,

"The Emperor of All Maladies is a history of eureka moments and decades of despair . Mukherjee describes vividly the horrors of the radical mastectomy , which got more and more radical , until it arrived at an extraordinarily morbid , disfiguring procedure in which surgeons removed the breast , the pectoral muscles , the axillary nodes , the chest wall and occasionally the ribs , parts of the sternum , the clavicle and the lymph nodes inside the chest . The story of cancer is a story of human ingenuity , resilience , and perseverance , but also of hubris , paternalism , and misperception . Mukherjee recounts centuries of discoveries , setbacks , victories , and deaths , told through the eyes of his predecessors and peers , training their wits against an infinitely resourceful adversary that , just three decades ago , was thought to be easily vanquished in an all-out war against cancer . The book reads like a literary thriller with cancer as the protagonist . From the Persian Queen Atossa , whose Greek slave may have cut off her diseased breast , to the nineteenth-century recipients of primitive radiation and chemotherapy to Mukherjees own leukemia patient , Carla , The Emperor of All Maladies is about the people who have soldiered through fiercely demanding regimens in order to surviveand to increase our understanding of this iconic disease . Riveting , urgent , and surprising , The Emperor of All Maladies provides a fascinating glimpse into the future of cancer treatments . It is an illuminating book that provides hope and clarity to those seeking to demystify cancer . born , to change the way we look at these diseases .

"This is the single most powerful non-fiction book that I have ever picked up . Lost my dad in March 2015 to complications following an allogenic stem-cell transplant ( he was in remission from hepatosplenic T-Cell lymphoma ) . I bought this book shortly after his death . Stared at it on my nightstand , unopened , for weeks . It haunted me , this topic of cancer . I didn\'t feel that it deserved more of my time , energy , or attention . One night , I worked up the courage to read the first few pages . Hours later , with my husband sound asleep next to me , I put it down - and I\ 've read it almost every night since , devouring each page . The author\ 's writing is so artful in places that I often re-read paragraphs because I\ 'm so in awe that he can string together words in such a beautiful , descriptive way . Mukherjee is , simply - brilliant . His writing is astounding . He uses simple , understandable analogies to explain very complex , technical processes . At some points , his punch line in a chapter made my heart skip - e . g . he may spend pages explaining a patient or a disease , only to reveal at the end of the chapter that it was HIS patient under HIS care just recently . It made the book so personal ; I felt like I was rooting for these people ( I am , each and every one of them )  . This book gives a personality to cancer ... it really is it\ 's own breathing , living , functioning animal . It also made me realize that exactly what makes cancer so indestructible , comes from WITHIN us . It is our own healthy cells\ ' ability to survive against all odds . Cancer isn\'t really it\ 's own entity ... it\ 's not a thing separate from us . It\ 's a malfunction of something already in us . One of the other reviewers of this book notes that if he had read this earlier in his life , he would have changed professions . I couldn\'t agree more . I won\'t lie - since reading this book , it has crossed my mind more than once to look into cancer research as a new career . This book is THAT profound . This book made me feel like the loss of my dad was not in vain . My dad was and is one of many who have died for this cause - research , education , progression towards a cure . A martyr , in a way . This book will do no good on my bookshelf . I think it should be required reading for , basically , everyone . Seriously . So , I\ 'm passing it on to a friend with strict instructions to pass it on when she\ 's done . I\ 'm considering giving this book to everyone I know for Christmas , with the same instructions .

I always tell my patients , I regard a cancer patient as a delicate vase sitting on a table , with 3 legs supporting it . Surgical oncology . Medical oncology . And Radiation Oncology . It appears that Dr .  Mukherjee has more or less chopped off the other 2 legs . For all the money and resources poured into cancer research since the 1960s ( from the basic research bench to the multi-institutional phase III randomized clinical trials ... medical oncology AND surgical/radiation oncology trials ...  . yes , there are big important clinical trials outside of Medical Oncology ) , we have barely made a dent in overall survival for our cancer patients .

"Sometimes you read a book that has the feel of being the definitive history of a subject , or at least it attempts to . This is certainly one of those . Now whether it is off the mark or biased I must leave to the true experts . This is a complex book with considerable detail and occasional dense material , leavened with names and more names . Instead of a history of how science did this and that , the author gets down to the individuals who did this research or ran that study , adding personality and rivalries to the mix . And of course , he is well along in the trend of telling stories , both in the scientists and patients , of the Carla has cancer ... . ilk . Occasionally I thought he was trying too hard .

The net results described in the book are actually not that great , with some notable exceptions . This isn\'t smallpox , vanquished .

"We read biographies for a multitude of reasons . For some of us it\ 's to satisfy prurient interest , for others it\ 's for inspiration , and for still others it\ 's about facts and history . What most of us don\'t realize , perhaps , is that we often look to biography to find out more about ourselves , and about what we can become . It\ 's for that reason that Siddhartha Mukherjee\ 's choice to present a history of one of our most dread diseases as a biography renders the work so powerful , and so disturbing . Like any good life story The Emperor of All Malad ies is a compendium of anecdotes . Central to them all is the testimony of the victims of this affliction , diverse in background but united by their experience of suffering and fear . Then there are the doctors and the researchers , revealed as so very human in these pages , as stubborn and blind at times as they are brilliant and inspired . There are the activists , with their soulful drive . And finally there are children . Mukherjee begins his study of this intruder in our midst by pointing out the fact of its relative youth . Cancer , he notes at the outset , is a disease of aging , the irony of which becomes apparent as we come to realize that this scourge is in the prime of its own life . Prior to the twentieth century , multitudes of other afflictions took precedence over cancer : tuberculosis , polio , measles , smallpox , and even influenza were all acute and deadly , and far more demanding of medicine\ 's attention . But cancer was always there , enigmatic , stealthy and patient . Cancer , Mukherjee informs us as he details the trials of the earliest cases of breast cancer recorded in 2500 BC , even as a clandestine illness , left its fingerprint on the ancient world , though fleetingly rare . And as science began its torrid march forward in the fight against other diseases which had for so long been a morbid fact of life , it found its quiet nesting place among the newly created older population . Only in the twentieth century did its full and complicated personality reveal itself . The timing of Mukherjee\ 's work is hopeful , for the most comprehensive biographies appear towards the end of the subject\ 's life , or afterwards . And indeed the publication of The Emperor of All Maladies comes on the heels of some of the most groundbreaking cancer research yet achieved . But reading this almost respectful , at times reverential work , one is struck by one if its central conclusions : this disease is the inverse reflection of ourselves . It\ 's possible that this quality is what has driven so many to take on this fight , filled as it is with personal agony and aspiration . Like our negative reflection , cancer is complex and resilient , always looking for new angles of survival . A cancer cell is a desperate individualist , and that\ 's what makes it so potent , and dangerous . The battle takes on the quality of a war against the worst things in ourselves , tenacity against the cruelest depredation.Cancer..was a disease unfolded slowly in time . It did not run , but rather slouched to its birth , argued Oscar Auerbach , a lung pathologist who blasted the trumpet about cigarette smoking in the mid 1950s . It was this observation that defined the disease\ 's life -- insidious , patient , inscrutable . And it was this quality that made its treatment so elusive . Mukherjee is at his best when exploring the internal agonies of those who devoted their lives to eradicating cancer , people like Sidney Farber and the redoubtable Mary Lasker , and of those who were eradicated by it . By defining them with such specificity and empathy , and shining light on their souls , he reveals the shadowy outline of the enemy they hoped to vanquish . As someone who just lost his mother to lung cancer two weeks ago , this reviewer found himself re-reading the chapter Prevention is the Cure , which provides tortured insight into the politics and profiteering of the tobacco industry and its fellow travelers , over and over . It\ 's painful to realize how Sisyphean is the task of pushing back , against corporate lobbyists , against the misguided certitudes of researchers and doctors , against time . And yet the fight continues . Even as medical science continues to prescribe the toxic chemotherapeutic agent cisplatin for dying patients ( as happened with my own father , who suffered bladder cancer for four months ) , and holds out the hope of life with targeted drugs like Tarceva ( my mother was treated with it -- it didn\'t work ) , each individual human being waits , and hopes this cynical opportunistic being won\'t knock on their door . But The Emperor of All Maladies shows us that we need not bow down before this tyrant . Mukherjee makes the case for putting fear aside , and shining ever brighter light on this elusive shade . In that light there\ 's hope .","work--doctors and the researchers, work--Mukherjee, work--timing of Mukherjee\ 's work, work, work--activists","Mixed, Positive, Positive, Mixed, Positive",,
"I am no closer to being an oncologist now than I was before I read the book , but it does have some laymens terms in it . It also has some testimonial stories in it , although more often than not they are the lab stories of the doctors involved instead of the patients . Still the book has popular appeal because it is a history and the subject concerns what any healthy adult has in the back of his mind . This book makes many references to Susan Sontag , a name I only otherwise know from a Dana Carvey imitation of Woody Allen , who also happens to be quoted in the book for saying , I do n't want to be immortal because of the movies I make . I want to be immortal by not dying . Other diseases referenced include tuberculosis , because of its domineering effect on society as a whole , as well as AIDS originally Gay-Related Immune Deficiency , which by viral connections was commonly thought to be another form of cancer . Early studies concerned blood , and the archaic suppuration of blood before leukemia was coined as the disease of the white blood cells . Sidney Farber and Carla are introduced , as pioneering doctor and Mukherjees patient respectively , at the same time . Against all odds , Carla does survive and is the thinly referenced but longest storyline in the book . A history of chemotherapy , radiation , X-rays , and pharmacy keeps the book moving over the past 150 years . Proper ways to measure treatment are debated , such as remission durations for those under fifty , or sixty or seventy , versus those over a given age . I am now basically clear on what is meant by acute symptoms or diseases . Mukherjees most basic explanation for increased cancer rates are smoking and the elimination of small pox , typhoid , TB , and inferior health care . The opportunity to live longer lives has made cancer an inevitability of the self . Unlike Marie Curie , whose exposure to scientific study killed her , typical cases of breast , cervical , and prostate cancer are for the most part unsolicited , cigarettes and their poor regulation being the exception . Mukherjee is noncommittal enough about cell phone use for me to think 2005 studies about brain tumors should not be dismissed . The Philadelphia Chromosome was some of the more complex scientific material related from the more modern genetic research . The Jimmy Fund was about a Swedish kid , who survived , named Einer who was a fan of the Boston Braves but connected to Ted Williams . The best writing may be the last two pages , a story that tempers nave optimism a reader might want to insist on , the death of Germaine Berne after six years of winning and losing against intestinal cancer . The authors stance overall on drugs would seem to be supportive , despite this quote from Voltaire : Doctors are men who prescribe medicines of which they know little , to cure diseases of which they know less , in human beings of whom they know nothing . This book is also a partial biography of Mary Lasker of the Laskerites .","book--writing, book","Positive, Positive",,

"This is now one of my all-time favorite books ( not just medical books ) that I have ever read . Dr .  Mukherjee may be a cancer physician , but I really hope he continues to write , as his prose is such a beautiful thing , and his ability to explain scientific concepts in such a way as to make them totally accessible to the lay public . It 's been so long since I read anything in the same class as this book . I had an absolutely awful time putting it down , even when I had classes to teach and grading to do . Usually I read several books at the same time , but this time , I read this book all the way through without bothering to look at anything else . Why did I pick this up ? I 've been teaching microbiology to nurses , and I knew that viruses often lead to cancer . I really wanted a better understanding of the science of how viruses can lead to cancer . I also had friends of my mom and dad who died with cancer back in the 1970 's , especially breast cancer ... and I wanted to know what , if anything has changed . I remember the declaration of the War on Cancer when I was a teenager , and it seems like we know significantly more thanks to genetics , but it also seems as if cancer has never given up holding the best 'hand' . Dr . Mukherjee did an incredibly job of intertwining the history of cancer with the ongoing story . Without the background half of what he explained would not have made such 'neat ' sense . And the stories of his individual patients and those of other doctors , helps the reader remember the humanity behind this saga . I get the feeling Mukherjee is a great and caring doctor as well . And given the amount of death that must be seen in this field , it must be hard to keep that humanity without becoming cynical . I 'm keeping this book ... and will probably read it again .","prose, book--Dr. Mukherjee, book--stories, book--Mukherjee, book","Positive, Positive, Positive, Positive, Positive",,

"Although nonfiction , this supremely interesting book on the history of cancer reads like a novel . It has a compelling plot , many interesting characters , and a subject matter that\ 's both timely and important . Dr . Mukherjee writes about a complex subject in a narrative manner that is understandable to the layman like myself . And while not being at all didactic in the patronizing sense , the book teaches the reader a great deal about cancer the disease and its treatment . You might not think it , but the journey through the history of cancer is actually somewhat uplifting simply because of the great strides that have been made since earlier rather barbaric treatments . And the author ends the book with caution about the elusive cure yet optimism for more effective future advancements in the fight against this killer disease that has touched so many of us or our loved ones . Bravo to Dr .  Mukherjee .","book--characters, book--subject matter, book--journey, book--Dr. Mukherjee, book--plot, book--narrative manner, book","Positive, Positive, Positive, Positive, Positive, Positive, Positive",,

"Fascinating and quite brilliant book about a complicated subject . Marred slightly by the lack of depth on preventing cancer . I 'd have thought it 's an aspect deserving a larger role . There are no shortage of places on the world with about 1/3 of the US ( and Australian , my country ) cancer rate . And we know that the difference between low rates and high rates is almost entirely lifestyle related ... even if identifying the factors is complex and made even more difficult by interference from large industries who both kill and lie as naturally as breathing ( the meat industry ) .","book--subject, book","Negative, Mixed",,

"I did n't like the way this book was presented . It was boring and long winded . The information presented jumped all over . There was no real flow to it . I was hoping to learn more about cancer that I did n't know before , but it just rambled on and on not making much sense . It seemed to be all over the place . Hard to follow . I could n't finish the book it was just too boring and the information presented went in all sorts of directions that was hard to keep straight . The author started with one story then not finish it until much later in different chapters . The information was spread all over the place . Nothing was put together to make sense . Ca n't recommend this book . Very thick book with important information spread every where . No cohesiveness . Important topic but not presented well . Do n't waste your time or money .","book--topic, book, book--way","Positive, Mixed, Negative",,

"This book was recommended by a dear friend and colleague , Dr .  John Eckenrode . I thoroughly enjoyed as it explained the history of diagnosing / treating cancer . I lost my eldest son with B-Cell ALL in 1983 and the protocols and results were right on the mark . No established protocol yet Matthew paved the way - surviving 11 Mos when survival rate was 4-6 weeks post diagnosis . Excellent and accurate material - and hope for future discoveries . I myself survived Pancreatic Cancer - a very rare PNET . New discoveries are made every day - hopefully soon we can treat this horrible disease with great success . That is my prayer .",book,Positive,,

"The best account of a portion of the history of medicine . This will give a reader an understanding not just of cancer - it is excellent at accomplishing that - but of how things work , and don\'t , in medicine as a field . The Emperor ... will naturally attract readers trying to understand cancer but should also be read by all care givers and , as a group , by historians .

"Siddhartha Mukherjee does beautiful job of walking us through the history of cancer . From the earliest discovery of mummies with afflicted organs cut away to the first mention of this disease being named in ancient writings . We visit labs in basements of dedicated pioneers seeking to understand the cause of gross growths choking off vital organs . Many spend their entire lifetimes performing experiments whose conclusions are snickered at by their contemporaries but are found to be the cornerstones of understanding what occurs when a normal cell suddenly bursts producing alien cells . This book is also a tribute to the patients who ultimately die and the doctors , nurses , scientists and families who push to find medicines and research to prolong future cancer patients ' lives and end the stigma of hopelessness that the prognosis of cancer brings . Beautifully as we near the end of the story , we revisit patients whose cancers seem to have disappeared from their bodies and have been able to return to a life that was presumed dead . We also see some questions still as unanswerable today as centuries ago . I recommend this book to anyone interested in this terrible disease .","book--end of the story, book","Positive, Positive",,

I am not sure that I have ever read a more thorough beginning to end explanation of any topic . Overall it was simply amazing to follow the fragmented evolution that was masterfully pieced together .

"When I read that Ken Burns had taken this book for a TV Series , it caught my attention . I had figured it for a dry , Pulitzer Prize winning book .

What a GREAT read . It is VERY well written . Understandable by non-scientists , a far amount of drama . It is sectioned in manageble segments and it turned into a page turner . Quite astonishing . Setting aside cancer , it also had important observations regarding research and its funding , the examples of working separately and how sometimes amazing collaborations were almost accidental . The shift to privately funded research and how it shifts to profit centers and leaves behind areas of interest that might benefit mankind . Fascinating .

"I recently finished watching the 6-hour television documentary based on this book , so it\ 's hard not to compare them as I was reading the book . I thought the documentary sometimes veered into weepy backstory territory ( my term for the unfortunate practice of reality shows\ ' pulling viewers\ ' heartstrings by having a participant tell about a family member with cancer or disability ) , but overall I thought the filmmakers did a good job with the book\ 's material . Oncologist Dr .  Mukherjee is an engaging writer ( and an engaging presence in the film ) and I think he does justice to the sometimes dry facts he has to work with . The first 150 pages or so are the best . The history/biography of cancer is very interesting and the early treatments seem either ridiculous or brutal , as well as nearly always ineffective , as seen through modern hindsight . Where the book sort of fell apart for me , and where I had to take a break from reading , was in the endless chapters about chemotherapy drug trials . This material gets a little repetitious . I wish Mukherjee had included more of his own patients\ ' stories in these sections rather than reciting endless facts about chemotherapy trials . I think it could have made this material a little more accessible . ( There are some patient\ 's stories included , but I would have liked a little more . ) I learned quite a bit about how the U.S. war on cancer came to be : through doctors and through philanthropic individuals who felt strongly about making the fight to beat cancer a priority , and pressuring the government to fund research . We have a lot to thank these people for , and we also owe a huge debt to both the patients ( many of them small children ) and their families for being willing to go through often-futile treatments in search of the one cure that always eluded them . These people were incredibly brave . This book highlights the fact that we still sometimes view cancer as a forbidden subject and that doctors sometimes still don\'t tell patients all the information they need once they\ 're diagnosed . However , books like this one , and films like the one based on it , will definitely help open up discussions and help both patients and doctors communicate effectively about how to treat this disease . I highly recommend this book for those with an interest in medicine and the history of medicine , and especially for potential medical students .","book--endless chapters, book, book--first 150 pages, book--Dr. Mukherjee, book--material","Negative, Mixed, Positive, Positive, Negative",,

I wanted to read it before the PBS special of the same name and was glad I did because I was able to focus on the new information in the TV special since I already had most of the basic background from the book . Anyone interested in if/when/how cancer accompanies our life journey should read this before the emperor appears .",book,Positive,,
