"Seriously , something 's wrong when you 're rooting for the protagonist to drop gloriously dead throughout the series . Why oh why could n't the whole thing have been about Epiny ? I would 've enjoyed that ... Renegade 's Magic , book III in the Soldier Son Trilogy , unfortunately does n't solve many of the problems of the first two installments ( i . e . slow pacing and a useless main character ) . It does n't , however , introduce any new issues either . Hobb is still an excellent writer . Her prose never fails to transport me into whatever world she 's writing about , her dialogue is fantastic , and her characterization , always a strong suit for her , is just as immaculate as anyone experienced with her work would expect . All of these things the book has going for it . But oh , Nevare , Nevare ... Hobb generally manages to include at least one good male character , from Captain Kennit in Liveship Traders to Fitz in the Assassin books . Okay , as time has gone on , her female characters generally tend to outshine them , but they 've still remained at least readable ... up until now . Nevare Burvelle is a bland , whiny , uncharismatic moron . He sighs , sobs , and whimpers his way through three novels , maddeningly unwilling to act on or even recognize what the reader sees to be obvious . He 's everything that Fitz was threatening to become in Tawny Man , and while , this being Hobb , it 's not actively bad ... it 's inescapably just boring . Irritatingly , the reason for Nevare 's faults is generally the same as the reason for Fitz 's in Tawny Man ... and , actually , it 's even hinted at being the reason for a few of Kennit 's in Liveship Traders . So ... may I just take this opportunity to say ... ENOUGH with the split souls already , Ms .  Hobb . It was an interesting experiment the first time around , and I was actually very impressed by how you managed to eliminate certain characteristics from your protagonist . But I found it very hard to keep reading about a protagonist I not only did n't admire but actively disliked . There 's only so far the godliness of the debut trilogy can keep us reading before we all just get fed up . If we MUST continue to see the soul-cut-in-half trope recur , can the hero of the next one at least end up getting the extroverted and action-oriented tendencies for once ? I think that 's really it : it 's rare that my opinion of a book is as simple as this , but it really is a simple divide this time . I love the world , I love the supporting characters , I love the idea , and I adore Hobb 's prose . But I simply can not find it in myself to like the protagonist . Call me shallow , but when I read a trilogy of books , I generally want at the very least a character I can endure , at best a character I admire in some way . Nevare is impossible to admire in almost any respect , intentionally constructed that way . And while I can admire the craft and artistry put into creating such a protagonist , while I can appreciate what Hobb has done with the elements of characterization , I still ca n't figure out WHY she had to do this not once , not twice , but THREE TIMES . Arguably , Kennit does n't deserve the same severity as the rest of them , so let 's exclude him . Still ... she 's DONE THIS BEFORE . WHY do it again ? I ca n't figure that out . Creating an unlikable lead is an interesting idea , but it 's basically an ego project , done simply to show off her skill and cleverness more than to give the reader a good time . Maybe I 'm old-fashioned , but I just think that 's a little backwards .","prose, book III in the Soldier Son Trilogy--Hobb, prose--dialogue, book III in the Soldier Son Trilogy--protagonist, Nevare, prose--characterization, female characters, book III in the Soldier Son Trilogy","Positive, Positive, Positive, Mixed, Negative, Positive, Negative, Mixed",,

"Review of Book and Ken Burns Series : One of the best books and also now one of the best Documentary 's out there . This is a 3 episode , three disc , exploration and history of one of the greatest mass murderers of all time , CANCER . This documentary is a thoughtful , moving , emotional journey into everything about cancer and what all the doctors , nurses , researchers and victims have gone through . Possibly one of the best , if not the best research examples ever done in written form , and now film form . I have read the book also which I highly recommend and now I highly recommended the 3 Disc Documentary that Ken Burns has created . I have never been so glued , moved , brought to tears as I have by this documentary . Not only does this book and documentary explore the vast history of this horror , but it also puts a face on this monster . It showcases the pain and suffering of those who are ravaged by this beast . It gives an example of not just a word but a living , breathing human being . Siddhartha Mukherjee is one of the finest human beings to ever grace book form , his book brought to life this horrible reality . He not only brought a face to the monster , but he allowed you to understand the history , and massive exploration for treatment and hopefully one day a cure . In a sense both Siddhartha Mukherjee and Ken Burns has given a voice to this darkness that slowly is causing thousands to die , suffer , or go through .

"Perhaps it is because I have n't read one of these action-packed , Hollywood-style thrillers in a while , but Will Adams 's The Alexander Cipher hit the nail on the head with its action , mystery , historical intrigue and entertaining characters . I 've always had a love of Alexandrian history and this has it aplenty . The chance at discovering Alexander the Great 's tomb was as exciting for me as it was for Daniel Knox and cast . The action was there in balance with intellectual , historical retelling , as well as the recounting of a few myths too . The Egyptian setting developed too , travelling from one side of Egypt to the other . Yes , it is slightly unoriginal , especially in today 's market , but that does n't mean you still can not enjoy it for what it is . The 'baddies ' are a little cliched , but again , entertaining .

"Stuart MacBride has used a true crime story as the basis for this novel , the sixth in the Logan McRae series . It serves as the main case among the Detective Sergeant\ 's work overload , exacerbating his moodiness , drinking and smoking , all of which is heightened , of course , by his interaction with DI Steele , one of the more interesting characters in the genre . On top of her continually riding Logan , he has to cope with another superior , incompetent DI Beattie . The main plot involves Richard Knox , a man convicted of raping an elderly grandfather . After serving his time , Knox decides to come to Aberdeen and occupy his late grandmother\ 's home . He is brought to the Scottish city by DI Danby , who originally arrested him . The arrival of Knox sets off waves of protest and his house is burned down . He is whisked off to a safe house , from which he is sooon kidnapped . Logan , among others , has the task of protecting Knox , so it falls to him to find him and the reason for his abduction . At the same time , DI Danby disappears , doubling Logan\ 's task . The lengthy novel is awash in various subplots , keeping Logan busy virtually 24/7 . It seems he has to stop a flood of counterfeit currency in Aberdeen , the murder of a confidential informant , and a couple of jewelry store robberies , among other side issues . All in a day\ 's ( or week\ 's ) work . Despite the book\ 's length , it is fast reading , tautly plotted and engrossing .

"The Emperor of All Maladies is a history of eureka moments and decades of despair . Mukherjee describes vividly the horrors of the radical mastectomy , which got more and more radical , until it arrived at an extraordinarily morbid , disfiguring procedure in which surgeons removed the breast , the pectoral muscles , the axillary nodes , the chest wall and occasionally the ribs , parts of the sternum , the clavicle and the lymph nodes inside the chest . The story of cancer is a story of human ingenuity , resilience , and perseverance , but also of hubris , paternalism , and misperception . Mukherjee recounts centuries of discoveries , setbacks , victories , and deaths , told through the eyes of his predecessors and peers , training their wits against an infinitely resourceful adversary that , just three decades ago , was thought to be easily vanquished in an all-out war against cancer . The book reads like a literary thriller with cancer as the protagonist . From the Persian Queen Atossa , whose Greek slave may have cut off her diseased breast , to the nineteenth-century recipients of primitive radiation and chemotherapy to Mukherjees own leukemia patient , Carla , The Emperor of All Maladies is about the people who have soldiered through fiercely demanding regimens in order to surviveand to increase our understanding of this iconic disease . Riveting , urgent , and surprising , The Emperor of All Maladies provides a fascinating glimpse into the future of cancer treatments . It is an illuminating book that provides hope and clarity to those seeking to demystify cancer . born , to change the way we look at these diseases . The book reminds us of our unique position in the history of medicine , and how were reinventing medicine .

"I bought this book because I did n't understand much of anything about cancer , and I really wanted to ( and still want to ) understand the basics . What is cancer ? How does it metastasize ? What is it like to face this illness ? What is it like to be a doctor treating these patients ? Etc . Instead this is a book about the fumbling missteps of doctors throughout history in trying various remedies , none of which worked . Instead of telling me what cancer is , I instead was told what the weather was like in Boston in 1947 . After 100 pages , I still had none of my questions answered and I gave up on the book . I did flip through it ... and hundreds of pages later I was still seeing stories about someone 's dark lab in 1920 or a paper from 1910 . I really would like a comprehensible description of what cancer is , how it works , what the best treatments are , how doctor 's approach this .

"Like many who have reviewed this book , I 'm a huge Robin Hobb fan , having read almost everything she 's published . This , by far , is the least-inspiring series of the bunch . For those who have read the Farseer trilogies , Nevare will come off as a flimsy carbon copy of Fitz : a conflicted , sometimes thick-headed , often goofy , but always heroic protagonist . Nevare is basically the same guy in a different outfit . In the first book of the Soldier Son series I was excited about the world Hobb was creating , and I always love the creative lengths she goes to describe the landscapes that her characters travel through ( she 's especially good at describing forests ! ) . But there was something just ... plodding and slow about this book . Not a lot happened and too much time was spent with Nevare having internal battles . And what should have been a clever plot device with Soldier 's Son and Nevare just wound up being clumsy and annoying to read , and really not that interesting . I wound up wishing one of them would just die so I would n't have to listen to the incessant bickering anymore . I would n't recommend this book to a first-time Hobb reader .

"While I preferred A Royal Duty more than The Way We Were : Remembering Diana , I still found this book entertaining . This book basically adds more of a dimension of Diana than A Royal Duty where Burrell spent much of the text on himself from childhood on , his work with the Queen , and how he handled Diana 's sudden death . The Way We Were focuses more on Diana 's relationships with friends and her interest in Dr .  Hasnat Khan . Burrell remained friendly with Khan , even giving him one of Diana 's perfume-scented headbands . This is Burrell 's second book on Diana . From my perspective , I find the ongoing criticism against Burrell unnecessary and ridiculous . He is frequently accused of betraying her trust but I believe none of the critics give a nickel about Diana 's trust being betrayed . The most criticism is made by other authors who are also writing about the princess . Probably the attacks are made because Burrell actually worked for Diana and knew her better than outsiders like Andrew Morton , Tina Brown , Penny Junor , Ingrid Seward , and others . Whenever I read another book on Diana , I always find a snipe or two about Paul Burrell in the text . These attacks are becoming tiresome and makes the author look petty and cheap . The bottom line for the criticism seems others want to make money off the continuing popularity of Princess Diana . Why should anyone buy the other author 's books when the reader can find out more details and more truths about Diana 's lifestyle and mindset from Burrell ? Books written by these other writers obviously have the slanted best interest of the royal family in mind as they compose every page .","A Royal Duty, Burrell, book","Positive, Positive, Positive",,

"This is now one of my all-time favorite books ( not just medical books ) that I have ever read . Dr .  Mukherjee may be a cancer physician , but I really hope he continues to write , as his prose is such a beautiful thing , and his ability to explain scientific concepts in such a way as to make them totally accessible to the lay public . It 's been so long since I read anything in the same class as this book . I had an absolutely awful time putting it down , even when I had classes to teach and grading to do . Usually I read several books at the same time , but this time , I read this book all the way through without bothering to look at anything else . Why did I pick this up ? I 've been teaching microbiology to nurses , and I knew that viruses often lead to cancer . I really wanted a better understanding of the science of how viruses can lead to cancer . I also had friends of my mom and dad who died with cancer back in the 1970 's , especially breast cancer ... and I wanted to know what , if anything has changed . I remember the declaration of the War on Cancer when I was a teenager , and it seems like we know significantly more thanks to genetics , but it also seems as if cancer has never given up holding the best 'hand' . Dr . Mukherjee did an incredibly job of intertwining the history of cancer with the ongoing story . Without the background half of what he explained would not have made such 'neat ' sense . And the stories of his individual patients and those of other doctors , helps the reader remember the humanity behind this saga . I get the feeling Mukherjee is a great and caring doctor as well . And given the amount of death that must be seen in this field , it must be hard to keep that humanity without becoming cynical .

"The Emperor of All Maladies is a no question a fascinating book . And it certainly merits the praise it has received . Mukherjee , however , needed a better editor . There are a number of solecisms , e.g. , careering for careening . But proof-reading aside , it badly needs some cutting . The obvious absurdity of the War on Cancer receives far to much attention , breaks the narrative flow and in my opinion constitutes one long digression.. A little too much human history . He could have learned from Paul de Kruifs classic Microbe Hunters ( still in print 90 years later ) , brevity for one . Seeing that Ken Burns has picked it up one has a slight suspicion that this was written with a TV documentary in mind so we have some drama added : it will be interesting to see how that is used .

Graduate education , at least during my time as a student , focused on the latest developments in the field without a look back through the lens of history . This book fills that gap beautifully , providing a timeline of the major discoveries , treatments past and present , and a glimpse at where the field could and should go . Also , as a non-clinical researcher , the stories of patients and the physicians who treated them - along with the scientists who provided those treatments - bring a necessary human element to the book .

"Although I 'm sure I 'm incorrect in most of the details , I sometimes picture the writing careers of Jonathan and Faye Kellerman as being sort of like A Star is Born . Jonathan was the first to be an established writer , and soon , Faye would follow . For a while , he was the star , but now -- despite his continued bestselling numbers -- his quality has faded considerably , and Faye is now clearly the better of the two . Within the past month or so , I 've read one book from each of them . Jonathan Kellerman 's Compulsion was another dud , and Faye Kellerman 's The Burnt House is another good work . The title residence is actually an apartment building in which a commuter plan has crashed into shortly after its takeoff from Burbank heading towards San Jose . The accident has occurred very close to the Granada Hills home of Peter and Rina Decker , and even closer to the school of their daughter Hannah . Fortunately , all are fine , but Peter , a police lieutenant who oversees homicide investigations , finds that there is still much to be done after the fires have been put out . In particular , Roseanne Dresden , though listed as one of the crash victims , is alleged by her step-father to have never been on the flight . She has disappeared , however , and the step-father suspects her philandering husband . Decker and his detectives try to determine if she was on the flight , but the airline refuses to disclose any information and there are no remains found at the crash site that belong to her . A body is found , but it is not Rosanne ; instead , it is a much older corpse apparently stashed in the apartment building decades ago and exposed after the crash . This leads to a second mystery , in trying to determine who the victim is and who killed her . Sadly , the resolution of this second plot will hinge on an incredible coincidence that Kellerman does n't really even try to justify . This coincidence hurts The Burnt House , but not irreparably ; overall , this remains a good book . Why does Faye Kellerman continue to succeed while her husband slides downhill ? As much as anything , it has to do with characters : Faye has created a world with a bunch of well-defined characters who have grown over time ( in fact , my one continued gripe with the series is that is marketed as a Peter Decker/Rina Lazarus mystery , when Rina has not used that last name in over a decade of fictional or real time ) . It 's been a little while since Kellerman has written a book in the series , but for her fans , it is worth that wait .","Burnt House--plot, Burnt House, Compulsion, Burnt House--Faye Kellerman, Compulsion--Jonathan Kellerman, book","Negative, Mixed, Mixed, Positive, Mixed, Positive","sentiment: ['positive', 'positive', 'negative', 'positive', 'negative', 'positive']","['positive', 'positive', 'negative', 'positive', 'negative', 'positive']"

"As a work of scholarship , this book is just tremendous . Mukherjee traces the history of our understanding of cancer from 2500 BC to present-day . He writes of political battles for public attention , incredible wiles in the biology of the disease , and schisms among the researchers sent to conquer it . All major developments are present and sourced in sixty pages of footnotes . From this grand historical scope , Mukherjee has crafted a tight and coherent narrative that I found very difficult to put down . I\ 'm aware of no lay account of cancer with anything approaching the level of depth present here . This book is unique . Like anything so vast , it isn\'t quite perfect . Certain structural changes would benefit fluency , though they\ 've no impact on my recommendation . * More humanizing characteristics and quotations . Smaller researchers , and occasionally even key players , are summed by little more than what they\ 've accomplished . There are perhaps a hundred contributors that Mukherjee covers , but with exception to a handful that have had tens of pages devoted to them or some peculiar eccentricity , they\ 're interchangeable and unmemorable . * A more even balance between discovery and those stricken by cancer . Mukherjee is at his best when he\ 's describing the struggles of his own patients . These stories are touching , personal , and an intensely interesting ground-level foil to the bird\ 's eye view of much of the book . The retrospective of cancer discovery is so vast and detailed that these rare moments where the story reverts to the present can feel like an oasis . Roughly half of The Emperor is comprised of five and ten-page vignettes where Mukherjee poses a question ( If XY , then could XYZ ... ? ) and resolves it with the travails of a researcher ( Person Q , a scientist at H , noticed ... ) . These accounts are often gripping , especially as advances accelerate in the mid-1980s , but sets of four or five in a series are enough to cause my attention to drift . * A different ending . In the final chapters , Mukherjee suggests he\ 'd originally intended to conclude with the death of a particular patient . By serendipity , that patient was still living in late 2009 . Given the great strides in cancer survival and the sense he conveys that genetics may well provide the magic bullets that so occupied the fantasies of early researchers , concluding on a high note would have been within the spirit of the book . Instead , Mukherjee describes another patient who did in fact die . This person was not previously introduced . She was a better fit for the narrative , but including her account for that purpose didn\'t strike the right tone to me . I\ 'd also like to have seen Mukherjee become more of a prognosticator in later chapters . There probably aren\'t a hundred people alive in a better position than the author to comment on the state of cancer research , to predict , or to theorize in new directions . Such insights are spare in The Emperor . Having so aptly dispensed with past and present , it left me wanting for more about the future . These notes aside , if you\ 've even a tangential interest in cancer or biology , Mukherjee\ 's opus remains a must-read .","Mukherjee\ 's opus--quotations, Mukherjee\ 's opus--account, Mukherjee\ 's opus--stories, Mukherjee\ 's opus--structural changes, Mukherjee\ 's opus, Mukherjee\ 's opus--retrospective of cancer discovery, Mukherjee\ 's opus--characteristics, Mukherjee\ 's opus--accounts, Mukherjee\ 's opus--narrative","Positive, Mixed, Positive, Positive, Mixed, Positive, Positive, Positive, Positive","sentiment: ['negative', 'positive', 'positive', 'positive', 'positive', 'positive', 'negative', 'positive', 'positive']","['negative', 'positive', 'positive', 'positive', 'positive', 'positive', 'negative', 'positive', 'positive']"

"While not a perfect literary book , it is an excellent account of three girls growing up in a truly sick environment . It is interesting to note however that while the cult was successful in brainwashing its adult ( 1st generation ) followers , they were not very successful in brainwashing the children ( 2nd generation ) born into the cult . I think this was the fatal flaw that David Burg never imagined . He assumed the children would follow without question and accept any violations enacted upon them . He did not realize that children can develop egos and an innate understanding of right and wrong at very young ages . So his experiment in brainwashing children was a failure . However , there are still many 1st generation adults who are still brainwashed to this day and are following Burg\ 's writings as if they are the word of God . It is these sad adults who deny that any children were abused because the way they see it if an adult rapes and beats a child in the name of love it is not abuse . As a follow up to this book , I would recommend reading The Children of God , the Inside Story by Deborah Davis ( Linda Burg ) , David Burg\ 's oldest daughter .

"This is a genre I absolutely love - combining historical fact with fiction . Will Adams has admirably done both in The Alexander Cipher . This was Adam 's debut novel - and the first in the Daniel Knox series . Knox is an Egyptologist . His primary interest is in Alexander the Great . For years , historians and archaeologists have been trying to find the final resting place of this fabled leader . When an unexplored catacomb is uncovered during the building of a parking lot , it may hold some answers . There are many groups who want to be the ones to find Alexander . For a group bent on restoring Macedonia to it 's former glory , they see this discovery as a catalyst to further their cause and will stop at nothing . For Daniel , it would be the find of his life , but will it be at the cost of his life ? The story cuts between seemingly disparate stories in the beginning , but all are connected to Alexander and his lost tomb . Adams gives us enough history to whet our curiosity , but not so much that your eyes glaze over . Many times I went and googled part of the story , fascinated with the history Adams presents . The undercurrents of greed , betrayal and manipulations are skillfully combined with history to produce a novel full of action , intrigue and adventure . The thrill of discovering the unknown is conveyed in his writing . Fans of Steve Berry , Dan Brown , Clive Cussler and James Rollins would enjoy this book .","book--history, book--writing, book--genre, book--Adams, book","Positive, Positive, Positive, Positive, Positive","sentiment: ['positive', 'positive', 'positive', 'positive', 'positive']","['positive', 'positive', 'positive', 'positive', 'positive']"
"I have profound respect for Robin Hobb as a writer . And she really went out on a limb with this book , indeed with the entire trilogy . I\ 'm sorry to say that , for me , that limb cracked about half way through , and it all came crashing to the slimy , mud covered , insert riddled ground . I don\'t read fantasy for any other reason than enjoyment . I need a break . I grab a book . This doesn\'t mean that the books have to be mindless or shallow . However , the unrelenting self-loathing of the main character ( s ) in this book was almost intolerable . The two cultures at war are also quite repulsive . I wanted to admire the environmentally aware Specks more than the European-Imperialist Gernians , but I found both cultures reprehensible . Unfortunately , the nature-loving Specks also made me feel quite nauseous . The descriptions of their foods and their gluttonous , morbidly obese mages wore thin after just a few chapters . I may have lost a few pounds in the few days it took me to read this book . The lead character , who was a part of both cultures , was COMPLETELY LOATHSOME AND REPULSIVE in all of his forms . I don\'t think I\ 've ever felt such disgust for a villain in a fantasy novel , let alone the hero . At several points , the character wants to die , and I hoped that he would . SPOILER ALERTHe does die , thank goodness , but we are not spared . Even after he DIED , he was completely disgusting . Not only did both halves represent only NEGATIVE sides of his character , his physical aspects were as disgusting as anyone can imagine . Grossly , disgustingly , morbidly fat , and needing to eat constantly ? It is quite normal for humans to be repulsed by such a person . A culture which is based on greed and obesity and gluttony -- well , I can\'t imagine what Robin was thinking . Magic comes from FOOD ? Yeeeccccch ! ! ! ! Which brings me to the inherently repulsive Specks . A disgusting name for a vile and unappealing culture . Nature-lovers my foot , they are as greedy , materialistic and selfish as any Conquistador ! The source of their unique -- and hideously described -- dappled skin caused new depths of gut-churning disgust . They are grotesque looking , and their culture is not what it\ 's cracked up to be . They love material wealth , and will use items inimical to their own kind to achieve power . The Specks\ ' appearance , their magic , their culture -- all made me want to jump into the novel and wipe them out with smallpox . The Gernians weren\'t any better , but at least vaguely familiar . ( Conquistadors , Pioneers , Manifest Destiny , Genocide , etc . ) I was better prepared for how unsympathetic THEY were . Easy to despise , but I needed some good guys to route for ! Why , Robin ? WHY ? I have a high tolerance for the foibles of fantasy . I\ 'm giving the book two stars , because Ms .  Hobb DID create unusual situations , and she is quite a good writer . I hope to never read such morally and physically repugnant descriptions again ... I actually skipped the last chapters ( after a character is eaten by a tree , I was DONE ) . The ending was trite and predictable , shucks -- I wanted every character DEAD . Most of them were , thank goodness ! However , our disgusting hero wreaked out an improbable happy ending after all . Yuck !","book, book--hero, book--last chapters, book--descriptions, book--lead character, book--main character, book--Robin Hobb, book--ending","Mixed, Negative, Negative, Negative, Negative, Positive, Positive, Negative",,
"An incredible book ! I was given a copy and read it in two days , because the action keeps going with so many surprises and the plot lines begin to twist together . The characters come in all flavors , not just good guys / bad guys , and the setting in Egypt is described extremely well . There is a tiny element of a love story but it does n't hijack the rest which was very refreshing . I also enjoyed the Alexander the Great plot premise and as a former archaeologist , I found the basic archaeology described quite plausible ( given the suspension of disbelief required for any such novel ! ) . A great read for armchair travelers , history buffs , and adventure buffs .","book--element, book--Alexander the Great plot premise, read, book--surprises, book, book--plot lines","Positive, Positive, Positive, Positive, Positive, Positive","sentiment: ['positive', 'positive', 'positive', 'positive', 'positive']","['positive', 'positive', 'positive', 'positive', 'positive']"

"The plot is complex , but I figured out the perp too soon to be really enjoyable . Also , just not a big fan of the writing style or the characters and way too much focus on their home lives for me . Every person in this book had some huge drama or tragedy in their past , which seems unrealistic . And the ending leaves open for another whole weird drama , which is probably on purpose , to be used later , but to be honest , I do n't think I will go out of my way to find more by this author . I did not get the same feel for Sweden as I have from other authors of similar type books . This could have taken place anywhere . And not in a good way . But obviously , most people really likes this book and the writing , so maybe it is just me .","book--way, book--author, book, writing","Negative, Negative, Mixed, Positive","sentiment: ['negative', 'negative', 'negative', 'negative']","['negative', 'negative', 'negative', 'negative']"

"Like many reviewers on here I did enjoy the first two books of this series despite their unnecessary length and slow pacing . I disliked Nevare and his constant blunders and inability to learn and grow from them . Often times Nevare would get into trouble ( deserving or not ) , wiggle out of it , and then turn around and do the same thing again to get in trouble . It was kind of maddening . However , the concept of the books was interesting , the sole perspective made it unique while being also annoying ( single perspective meant that every time some back story was needed readers are basically given a long lecture or narrative in the form of a letter or boring conversation . ) , and there was just something that kept drawing me back to the story more than many other fantasy novels . I truly wanted to see how this series would end . Unfortunately this book was a massive disappointment to me . Easily the worst of the 3 and in my mind so bad that I probably would move to not even recommend the series to anyone . Sad really because Shaman 's Crossing did have many enjoyable moments and Forest Mage also did well . It seems as though Hobb took all of the unpleasant elements of the first two novels and just loaded up on them . In the final installment we find Nevare as annoying as ever , still immature and crabby BUT now he has lost control of his body . This makes for a unique reader perspective but it just becomes so labor intensive I found it more of a distraction . The 3rd installment introduces a ton of new characters , all of whom are unlikeable . Most of the previous characters from the set up books are mostly ignored except for some of Nevare 's rambling dream sequences . In fact most of the 3rd book is basically Nevare walking around the woods with a bunch of annoying people eating and whining about things . And seriously how many times can this guy die or try and kill himself ? It was a real disappointment because I invested quite a bit of time into this series with high hopes it would all be worth it . Instead Robin delivered more of the worst and very little of value . I am suspect that Hobb can write men at this point . Nevare ( and other men in the series ) really do not think or act like men . I would know as I am one . I found myself having to constantly remind myself of how old Nevare actually was because based on his maturity I would not wager he was older than a 13 year old girl . Finally the ending , the payoff , what I had waded through 600+ pages of junk and 2000 total for . What a waste . The SS trilogy always read slow and methodically with every bit of tension building over long periods of time for a dramatic event yet the final conclusion wraps up so quickly it seemed she either got bored of the series or missed her deadline . The final chapters are completely out of character from the base material of the series . Plus it was way too fairytale for my liking especially considering the dark and brutal nature of the first 2 novels . I was really hoping this series could be something I could have been real proud of and something I could recommend to my friends . Heck I really WANTED to like this book . But it was really awful . As others said it could have been 300 pages and still been too long . It was too boring , filled with too many unlikeable and pointless characters , and had a complete cop out ending . If you have read the 1st two novels be prepared to be disappointed with this novel . Heck you may want to just stop now and imagine your own ending for the series . It probably will be better than this . If you have not read this series I must now advise you stay away . Even though I truly enjoyed the 1st two books I can not in good faith advise anyone to invest the time in them with such a horrible conclusion .","Shaman 's Crossing--moments, 1st two books, series--concept, novel--Nevare, 1st two books--pacing, series, novel--new characters, novel--Hobb, series--pacing, Forest Mage, series--length, series--sole perspective, novel, 1st two books--length, series--final chapters, series--Nevare, It","Positive, Mixed, Positive, Negative, Negative, Mixed, Negative, Negative, Negative, Positive, Negative, Mixed, Negative, Negative, Negative, Negative, Negative",,

"Forest Mage finishes up the Soldier Son trilogy and was on par with the other two books . All three books were paced the same and this third book felt no different or raised anymore excitement than the other two . It was a satisfying book , and I enjoyed it . The character development as usual was top notch , but the world building in this final story was almost extinct . The plot wasn\'t the most exciting or challenging that I\ 've read , but nevertheless it was acceptable . I know this is Robin Hobb\ 's least liked series , but I would still recommend the book and series . I got a lot of enjoyment out of the books , felt a strong attachment with Navare and sympathized with both races : the Specks and the Gernains . The third book wraps up Nevare\ 's plight between the Specks and the Gernains . Nevrare now has been taken over by his split self Soldier Boy and Soldier Boy has no love for the Gernains , and plans to destroy the town of Getty\ 's to save the spirit trees of the specks . Nevare is now trapped and can\'t control Soldier Boy and must follow along even though he does not want to destroy his own people and friends . The whole book pretty much is the story of two different aspects of one person sharing the same body , and the conflict that is occurring in both parts . The conclusion raps up very nicely , in fact maybe a little bit too nicely as everything comes to a happy ending . But I guess that\ 's what I wanted all along . I give the book a thumbs up !","book, third book, book--world building, book--character development, books","Mixed, Positive, Positive, Positive, Positive","sentiment: ['positive', 'positive', 'negative', 'positive', 'positive']","['positive', 'positive', 'negative', 'positive', 'positive']"

"This was my first experience reading a Faye Kellerman novel .

It 's a sound police procedural though and Ms .  Kellerman 's love and knowledge of California and Santa Fe , New Mexico come through in spades .
