dotsa/new_Hotels_test,"Unfortunately I am unable to give a positive review of our stay over Christmas at Gloria 's place . When my family of five arrived from CA there was no heat on the upper floor of the apartment at all ( and was n't fixed for two days ) . Gloria does n't live close by so my husband had to do all the coordination with letting the heat guy in and out of the building . The house was minimally furnished , almost like someone had moved out and just left the beds and a couple of couches . Acres of empty bookshelves , only one bedside table in all of the four bedrooms , arms of chairs and couches in the living room were loose . There were no blankets on any of the beds ( only light summer comforters ) . Gloria did go out and buy blankets after we asked . There was no light in the narrow , steep stairs between the floors and it never did get fixed while we were there . The apartment was pretty dirty , despite contacting Gloria ahead of time after reading other reviews . The kitchen is very basically outfitted , with mismatched silverware and only a few cooking pots . We also discovered all the smoke detectors tossed in a cabinet and a moldy bowl of popcorn in the kitchen . Lastly , after we left we got a very rude text about putting the trash out incorrectly when we had received no specific instructions on recycling cardboard . Overall , I can not agree with the listing description that describes the place as a `` luxury apartment '' . My husband likened it to a grand old lady who had seen better days ... Gloria seemed a bit defensive and it felt like every question we had , or thing we requested , she took personally . The single plus ( and it is a big one ) is that the location is very good , near Boston Common and Charles St .  restaurants and shops . Hopefully Gloria will spend some time cleaning , furnishing and outfitting this lovely old place more completely , it really could be fabulous . We detailed our experience to Airbnb with pictures and they provided us with a nice travel credit . Very good customer service .","place--heat,","Negative,",Negative

Gloria does n't live close by so my husband had to do all the coordination with letting the heat guy in and out of the building . The house was minimally furnished , almost like someone had moved out and just left the beds and a couple of couches . Acres of empty bookshelves , only one bedside table in all of the four bedrooms , arms of chairs and couches in the living room were loose . There were no blankets on any of the beds ( only light summer comforters ) . Gloria did go out and buy blankets after we asked . There was no light in the narrow , steep stairs between the floors and it never did get fixed while we were there . The apartment was pretty dirty , despite contacting Gloria ahead of time after reading other reviews . The kitchen is very basically outfitted , with mismatched silverware and only a few cooking pots . We also discovered all the smoke detectors tossed in a cabinet and a moldy bowl of popcorn in the kitchen . Lastly , after we left we got a very rude text about putting the trash out incorrectly when we had received no specific instructions on recycling cardboard . Overall , I can not agree with the listing description that describes the place as a `` luxury apartment '' . My husband likened it to a grand old lady who had seen better days ... Gloria seemed a bit defensive and it felt like every question we had , or thing we requested , she took personally . The single plus ( and it is a big one ) is that the location is very good , near Boston Common and Charles St .  restaurants and shops . Hopefully Gloria will spend some time cleaning , furnishing and outfitting this lovely old place more completely , it really could be fabulous .

EVERYTHING is close-by ! The place itself is very spacious . We had 7 people ( some were children ) staying there , but we had lots of family in town so we had guests over constantly and it was plenty of room .

One note for anyone looking at this place who is planning to bring kids : It 's not really ideal for small children . We have a 3 year old and a 1 year old . There are 3 flights of very steep , old stairs . We rented baby gates and it was mostly fine , but still a little stressful and tricky with our wobbly 14-month-old .

Penny was extremely informative and knowledgeable about the area , and what places any out of towner might want to check out . We were only in town for 3 days , but heeding her advice we felt as if we saw very much the city of Boston in our short time there . She provides you with maps , a detailed booklet of info containing history and resources , and has a wealth of knowledge about the place she calls home . Penny and her son , as hosts , were warm and inviting , courteous and respectful , and just genuinely generous . There was coffee waiting for us downstairs every morning and we were welcome to anything in the fridge . Penny herself was interesting and easy to talk to , and spent time talking candidly with us about all manner of subjects , from current political events to life in general . She was engaging when it called for it , but was extremely mindful and respectful of our privacy and personal space . All in all , Penny helped to make our first trip to Boston ( and first ever experience with air bnb ) extremely enjoyable and memorable .
