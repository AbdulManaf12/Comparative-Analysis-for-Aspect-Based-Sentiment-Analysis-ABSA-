dotsa/new_Restaurant_test,Best pint of Guinness in town . Staff are friendly . Toilets are clean . They dont serve food yet ( December 2017 ) but it 's an Irish bar and I 'm from Ireland so I do n't go to bars for food .

dotsa/new_Restaurant_test,"Disappointed . The absence of other diners on a Friday night should be a clue . Our usual Szechuan place was closed for vacation , so we wandered another block to this place . Its been here more than 30 years , so I figured it had something going for it . The decor has n't changed . There was one large group enjoying themselves , and they brought their own beverages , so they must know the place . The 4 items we ordered were brought one at a time , as that 's their style . We had to ask for the 4th and 3rd to come together or they would have staggered them , too . The lemon chicken was awful .

For drinks , I had their raspberry champagne cocktail , which was so lovely , I had three or four of them ( I lost count ) . For dinner I ordered the duck breast which was cooked beautifully . My husband had the braised short-ribs and loved them .

First , there were gluten-free rolls . Do you have any idea what a treat it is to enjoy the bread course at dinner ? Yum ! For drinks , I had their raspberry champagne cocktail , which was so lovely , I had three or four of them ( I lost count ) . For dinner I ordered the duck breast which was cooked beautifully .

dotsa/new_Restaurant_test,"Very cool venue , having re-purposed an old theater . After walking through a wide hallway , the restaurant opens up to a large dining room . With the bar in the center and the kitchen in the back , tables are organized around the area . As a certified barbecue judge , I had to get the sampling platter . You can pick 3 meats for $ 30 . I chose the brisket , the ribs , and the pulled pork ( 3 of the 4 staples of KCBS judging )  . Each meat was flavorful and moist . Not overcooked or dry . They all had a nice smokiness and an easy pull texture . I dont think of Ohio having a particular bbq style , but the meat came unsauced , with four different selections at the table . Overall , quite tasty , no surprise its not the first location .",Each,"Positive,",Positive

dotsa/new_Restaurant_test,"I had some high expectations for this place given that its suppose to be a fine dining type of joint . My girlfriends and I came here for restaurant week dinner , so after class , we head over to Harvest and were promptly seated .

The soup did n't tast like anything special to be honest ... I wanted some flavors , but was disappointed with blandness . The quail was probably the best part of my meal ... juicy and tender . I could have used more flavor , but it was fine . Finally , the hazelnut torte was eh..

The wife enjoyed the wild boar pozole ( it is spicy ) and I had the coffee braised short ribs . Each had a great presentation and served at the right temperature . For appetizers , we had the calamari and tuna tartare and they were excellent . The staff was careful to keep the table clear and the water glasses filled , etc . during the evening so that was a nice pleasure . Lastly , the infused bloody mary is probably the best bloody mary Ive had . I look forward to going back !","place--calamari,","Positive,",Positive

dotsa/new_Restaurant_test,"I absolutely love this place and consider it a go-to when I am in the mood for a quiet dinner or when I have family in town ( and my family is Italian with high standards when it comes to food ! ) I cant say enough good things about Monica 's Trattoria . It 's ALWAYS really really good . The specials ( salads and entrees ) never disappoint and they like to keep the menu fresh and interesting by offering a nice variety of options . I always get a salad - either their basic green salad , the capresse salad or one that is special for the evening . You ca n't go wrong with any of the seafood dishes . The gnocchi with tomato cream sauce is excellent . When I was there this past weekend , I had an espresso after dinner and that was one of the best I have had in Boston .

dotsa/new_Restaurant_test,"This place is located in the corner of Pike Street Market . After eating lunch at other stops in the market ( ramen , pizza , shawarma etc ) , we came here to try the Salt & Straw ice cream . Unlike the their parent brand , Wiz Bang Bar only serves soft serve ice cream and its only $ 4 . We ordered the Coffee flavor with a Hand-Dipped Cone in Single Origin Chocolate . The flavors blend perfectly together . I especially enjoyed eating the chocolate shell off the soft serve since it has a different texture than the soft serve itself ( which I 'm generally not a huge fan of ) . The cone was n't very big , but since we had a full lunch , the two of us did n't even finish the whole thing and ended up throwing the cone away . When they give you the cone , they put a little dripping guard on the cone that 's kind of like a skirt . Although I 'm sure they 're not the only place that does this , I greatly appreciated the convenience , especially when we got to our car and that 's when soft-serves tend to get messy . Flavor and taste-wise this place is delicious and refreshing . Wish they had this in Seattle .","place--cone,","Negative,",Neutral

We were running a bit late and knew for sure that we were going to hit Mike 's , but decided to stop in for dinner . We were seated quickly and were pleased with the wide selection on the menu and the prices were n't too bad either . Our server was attentive and did a nice job taking care of things during dinner . We had the chicken parm and chicken fettucini alfredo . The red sauce paired nicely with a glass of Chianti and the white sauce went well with the Chardonnay/Pinot blend . We 've been to a number of establishments in the North End and this was BY FAR , the larger pour of wine by the glass we 've seen . Our only disappointment was the pre-meal bred . The bread was obviously day old , if not older . The crust was inedible and was served only with packets of butter . Other establishments on the North End spoil you with tasty oils and fresh bread ... that 's a big miss here ! This is the only thing holding Cafe Pompeii back from 5 stars ! Overall we were pleased . For the price you certainly ca n't beat the quality of the food or the service . Do n't let all the whiners scare you away , give it a shot !",Cafe,"Positive,",Positive

I had very high expectations of the $ 13 lobster mac and cheese . The lobster was minimal and and the cheese was greasy . We shared the fish and chips , nothing special . And we also shared the potato croquette . I like that it was made with shredded potatoes , but again , nothing special . Overall I thought the prices were too high for mediocre food . I hear they have a good happy hour though , so if I was in the area I 'd probably go for that .","place--lobster,","Mixed,",Negative

But the quality and the taste of the food has deteriorated dramatically since then . All the curries taste very similar : tomatoe-y and creamy . The chicken in the butter chicken seemed to be left over from something else , the malai kofta had a bad smell like they were very old or had gone bad ( they replaced it and the new batch tasted a bit better ) , and the vindaloo was just average . Even the paneer pakora tasted like the paneer had gone bad . The staff was very polite and tried to be as accommodating as possible , but the food was what it was . I am very disappointed .
