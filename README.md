## Overview
This repository contains code and documentation for a research project that explores the comparative analysis of Large Language Models (LLMs) and traditional models in the context of [Your Research Focus]. The study aims to [Briefly Summarize Your Research Goals].

## Table of Contents
1. [Datasets](#datasets)
2. [Code](#code)
3. [Models](#models)
4. [Performance Analysis Results](#Performance Analysis Results)

## Data
The `datasets` directory includes datasets used in the analysis. Detailed information about data sources and preprocessing steps can be found [here](datasets).

## Code and Results
The `code and results` directory contains scripts for data preprocessing, model training, Model predictions, and visualization. Visit these links for details (Codes and results_LLM, Codes and results_LSTM, Codes and results_flan_t5, codes and results_deberta) to run the code.

## Models
The `models` directory includes separate folders for LLMs and traditional models. Individual scripts or notebooks for each model's implementation are available. Pretrained models, if applicable, can be found [here](./models/README.md).

## Performance Analysis Results
Explore the `Performance Analysis Results` directory for key metrics, graphs, and visualizations obtained from the analysis. More details on the analysis process can be found [here](Results and performance analysis).

## Paper
The paper is submitted for review.
